         "YouTube says no ‘deepfakes’ or ‘birther’ videos with toughened 2020 election stance\nYouTube is making clear there will be no “birtherism” on its platform during this year’s U.S. presidential election – a belated response to a type of conspiracy theory more prevalent in the 2012 race.\nThe Google-owned video service is also reiterating that it won’t allow election-related “deepfake” videos and anything that aims to mislead viewers about voting procedures and how to participate in the 2020 census.\nYouTube clarified its rules ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday. The company is mostly reiterating content guidelines that it has been putting in place since the last presidential election in 2016.\nIts ban on technically manipulated videos of political figures was made apparent last year when YouTube became the first major platform to remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But the announcement Monday further clarifies that it will take down any election-related videos that are technically altered to mislead people in a way that goes beyond simply taking clips of speech out of context. The company also said it would remove doctored videos that could cause “serious risk of egregious harm” – such as to make it appear that a government official is dead.\n'Hey Google, show me photos': Google presents emotional 'Loretta' Super Bowl commercial\nFacebook: Sheryl Sandberg updates her relationship status with engagement announcement\nFacebook, which last year had resisted early calls to yank the Pelosi video, said in January that it was banning “deepfake” videos, the false but realistic clips created with artificial intelligence and sophisticated tools. Such videos are still fairly rare compared to simpler “cheap fake” manipulations such as were used in the video that altered Pelosi’s speech to make it seem like she was slurring her words.\nGoogle also said Monday that it will remove any videos that advance false claims about whether political candidates and elected officials are eligible to serve in office. That had been policy before, but wasn’t made explicit.\nThe company’s announcement comes about nine years after celebrity businessman Donald Trump began to get notice for claiming that Barack Obama, the nation’s first African American president, was not born in the United States.\nTrump repeatedly voiced citizenship doubts even after Obama produced his long-form birth certificate. Trump only fully backed off from the idea in the final stages of his 2016 presidential campaign.\nYouTube said it will also crack down on any attempts to artificially increase the number of views, likes and comments on videos. It changed its systems for recommending what videos users watch last year in a push to curb harmful misinformation. Twitter and Pinterest also last week outlined their efforts to reduce election misinformation on their platforms.\nMisinformation: Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter scramble to contain cororavirus misinformation\nDeepfakes: How to spot them on Facebook and YouTube ahead of the presidential election",

         "Speaking to the country for the first time from the Oval Office Tuesday night, President Donald Trump doubled down on his demands for a border wall in a brief speech amid his self-induced government shutdown\nDemocrats remain completely opposed to the president’s proposal for a wall and arranged to respond to Trump’s remarks shortly after he made them. Ahead of the speech, there was widespread debate about the TV network’s decision to broadcast the speech at all, given Trump’s propensity to lie and mislead about this subject in particular.\nHere are five of the lies or misleading statements he made in the address:\n1. Trump claimed there is a “security” crisis on the border.\nWhile there has been an increase in children and families crossing the border seeking asylum in recent months, the rate of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is actually much lower than it has been in recent history, as Vox’s Dara Lind explained. The Trump administration’s claims that there is some sort of terrorism risk from the border have been debunked. So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.\n2. Trump said illegal immigration drives down wages.\nOne of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers. While some economists argue this to be the case for some lower-income workers, many others disagree. But even if it’s true, the impact of immigrants on wages is marginal, and it could be completely wiped out by pro-labor policies that Trump and other Republicans oppose, like raising the minimum wage and protecting unions.\n3. Trump lied and said that the Democrats requested a “steel barrier.”\nDemocrats have not requested a steel barrier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that she wants to spend exactly $0 on the wall — no matter what it’s made out of.\n4. Trump said the border wall will pay for itself.\nTrump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself. There’s no reason to believe this is the case — especially when it’s considered that the government will not only have to pay for the construction of the wall, but for any land seized to build the wall through eminent domain.\n5. Trump said the new version of NAFTA will also pay for the wall.\nThe new version of NAFTA, which Trump calls USMCA, has some minor modifications from the original version. However, there’s no plausible argument that it will somehow pay for the wall. And even if it did, it hasn’t even been passed by Congress yet.",

         "The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”\nThis sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.\nThis argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.\nThe Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.\nHer ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.\nThe author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”\nThis shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.\nThis is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.\nI am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.\nLooking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.\nIn contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.\nBearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.\nOf course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.\nIt was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.",

         "In Barack Obama’s first term, the administration came to a fairly obvious conclusion: to address the climate crisis, we’re going to need to reduce emissions, and in the United States, the #1 source of carbon pollution is transportation. With that in mind, the Democratic White House created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.\nManufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.\nThen Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.\nBy way of a defense, the Trump administration said the new policy would improve auto safety – which as we discussed at the time, makes about as much sense as it sounds.\nNevertheless, the Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. But the New York Times reports today on an unexpected twist: auto manufacturers believe the White House’s anti-climate plans have gone too far.\nThe world’s largest automakers warned President Trump on Thursday that one of his most sweeping deregulatory efforts – his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards – threatens to cut their profits and produce “untenable” instability in a crucial manufacturing sector. In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo, the automakers asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback of one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to fight climate change.\nThe problem for the industry has become a practical one: Trump intends to go so far in gutting pollution safeguards that many states intend to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.\nThat includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.\nThe result is an exceedingly messy economic dynamic, in which car manufacturers in the United States – which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy – will have to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.\nNot surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.\nThe industry seems to realize this is a mess it helped create: companies wanted Trump to roll back Obama-era standards, so he did. What manufacturers didn’t realize is (a) how far the Republican would go; and (b) what would happen if they got what they wanted.\nComplicating matters, of course, there’s a decent chance a Democrat will win the presidency next year, at which point he or she will likely abandon Trump’s pro-pollution posture and go back to the auto industry with some thoughts about even more stringent emissions rules.\nThe industry wants the White House to negotiate some kind of deal with California, with the intention of creating a national standard that everyone can live with. That seems unlikely: Team Trump broke off talks with the Golden State months ago, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has rejected the idea of halfway measures.\nWatch this space.",

         "Republicans should stop fighting amnesty, President Obama said on Thursday, because one day a Hispanic will become president.\n“Over the long term, this is going to get solved, because at some point there’s going to be a President Rodriguez or there’s going to be a President Chen,” Obama told a Florida International University town hall audience, hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC.\n“The country is a nation of immigrants, and ultimately it will reflect who we are and its politics are going to reflect who we are,” Obama continued, implying that neither native-born Americans or legal immigrants have moral standing to determine who enters and stays in the country.\nHispanic foreigners attending the town hall — Fox News Latino did not say whether they were legal or illegal aliens — told Obama they feared that federal Judge Andrew Hansen’s stay on Obama’s executive order will force them to return to their home countries. (Fox News Latino incorrectly identifies Hansen as a Texas judge.)\nThe five million illegal aliens covered by Obama’s executive order could also cash in on as much as $35,000 in taxpayer handouts. That’s a minimum $175 million cost to American taxpayers for the first year alone, not counting the massive strain the low-income, poorly-educated, gang-prone aliens with high rates of illegitimacy and untreated diseases will place on the country’s medical and social institutions.\nObama’s claim that “history” was on his side is arguably false. The massive, historically unprecedented wave of immigrants crashing across the U.S. southern border is a political phenomenon, set in motion by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and accelerated by the Obama administration’s disastrous Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\nThe explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.\nEach year, four million Americans seeking jobs turn 18. In 2012, almost six million Americans graduated from college, saddled with an average $27,000 in student loan debt — $8,000 less than the handouts available for illegals presently in the country.\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.",

         "YouTube says no ‘deepfakes’ or ‘birther’ videos with toughened 2020 election stance\nYouTube is making clear there will be no “birtherism” on its platform during this year’s U.S. presidential election – a belated response to a type of conspiracy theory more prevalent in the 2012 race.\nThe Google-owned video service is also reiterating that it won’t allow election-related “deepfake” videos and anything that aims to mislead viewers about voting procedures and how to participate in the 2020 census.\nYouTube clarified its rules ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday. The company is mostly reiterating content guidelines that it has been putting in place since the last presidential election in 2016.\nIts ban on technically manipulated videos of political figures was made apparent last year when YouTube became the first major platform to remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But the announcement Monday further clarifies that it will take down any election-related videos that are technically altered to mislead people in a way that goes beyond simply taking clips of speech out of context. The company also said it would remove doctored videos that could cause “serious risk of egregious harm” – such as to make it appear that a government official is dead.\n'Hey Google, show me photos': Google presents emotional 'Loretta' Super Bowl commercial\nFacebook: Sheryl Sandberg updates her relationship status with engagement announcement\nFacebook, which last year had resisted early calls to yank the Pelosi video, said in January that it was banning “deepfake” videos, the false but realistic clips created with artificial intelligence and sophisticated tools. Such videos are still fairly rare compared to simpler “cheap fake” manipulations such as were used in the video that altered Pelosi’s speech to make it seem like she was slurring her words.\nGoogle also said Monday that it will remove any videos that advance false claims about whether political candidates and elected officials are eligible to serve in office. That had been policy before, but wasn’t made explicit.\nThe company’s announcement comes about nine years after celebrity businessman Donald Trump began to get notice for claiming that Barack Obama, the nation’s first African American president, was not born in the United States.\nTrump repeatedly voiced citizenship doubts even after Obama produced his long-form birth certificate. Trump only fully backed off from the idea in the final stages of his 2016 presidential campaign.\nYouTube said it will also crack down on any attempts to artificially increase the number of views, likes and comments on videos. It changed its systems for recommending what videos users watch last year in a push to curb harmful misinformation. Twitter and Pinterest also last week outlined their efforts to reduce election misinformation on their platforms.\nMisinformation: Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter scramble to contain cororavirus misinformation\nDeepfakes: How to spot them on Facebook and YouTube ahead of the presidential election",

         "Speaking to the country for the first time from the Oval Office Tuesday night, President Donald Trump doubled down on his demands for a border wall in a brief speech amid his self-induced government shutdown\nDemocrats remain completely opposed to the president’s proposal for a wall and arranged to respond to Trump’s remarks shortly after he made them. Ahead of the speech, there was widespread debate about the TV network’s decision to broadcast the speech at all, given Trump’s propensity to lie and mislead about this subject in particular.\nHere are five of the lies or misleading statements he made in the address:\n1. Trump claimed there is a “security” crisis on the border.\nWhile there has been an increase in children and families crossing the border seeking asylum in recent months, the rate of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is actually much lower than it has been in recent history, as Vox’s Dara Lind explained. The Trump administration’s claims that there is some sort of terrorism risk from the border have been debunked. So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.\n2. Trump said illegal immigration drives down wages.\nOne of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers. While some economists argue this to be the case for some lower-income workers, many others disagree. But even if it’s true, the impact of immigrants on wages is marginal, and it could be completely wiped out by pro-labor policies that Trump and other Republicans oppose, like raising the minimum wage and protecting unions.\n3. Trump lied and said that the Democrats requested a “steel barrier.”\nDemocrats have not requested a steel barrier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that she wants to spend exactly $0 on the wall — no matter what it’s made out of.\n4. Trump said the border wall will pay for itself.\nTrump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself. There’s no reason to believe this is the case — especially when it’s considered that the government will not only have to pay for the construction of the wall, but for any land seized to build the wall through eminent domain.\n5. Trump said the new version of NAFTA will also pay for the wall.\nThe new version of NAFTA, which Trump calls USMCA, has some minor modifications from the original version. However, there’s no plausible argument that it will somehow pay for the wall. And even if it did, it hasn’t even been passed by Congress yet.",

         "The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”\nThis sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.\nThis argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.\nThe Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.\nHer ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.\nThe author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”\nThis shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.\nThis is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.\nI am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.\nLooking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.\nIn contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.\nBearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.\nOf course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.\nIt was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.",

         "In Barack Obama’s first term, the administration came to a fairly obvious conclusion: to address the climate crisis, we’re going to need to reduce emissions, and in the United States, the #1 source of carbon pollution is transportation. With that in mind, the Democratic White House created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.\nManufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.\nThen Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.\nBy way of a defense, the Trump administration said the new policy would improve auto safety – which as we discussed at the time, makes about as much sense as it sounds.\nNevertheless, the Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. But the New York Times reports today on an unexpected twist: auto manufacturers believe the White House’s anti-climate plans have gone too far.\nThe world’s largest automakers warned President Trump on Thursday that one of his most sweeping deregulatory efforts – his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards – threatens to cut their profits and produce “untenable” instability in a crucial manufacturing sector. In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo, the automakers asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback of one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to fight climate change.\nThe problem for the industry has become a practical one: Trump intends to go so far in gutting pollution safeguards that many states intend to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.\nThat includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.\nThe result is an exceedingly messy economic dynamic, in which car manufacturers in the United States – which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy – will have to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.\nNot surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.\nThe industry seems to realize this is a mess it helped create: companies wanted Trump to roll back Obama-era standards, so he did. What manufacturers didn’t realize is (a) how far the Republican would go; and (b) what would happen if they got what they wanted.\nComplicating matters, of course, there’s a decent chance a Democrat will win the presidency next year, at which point he or she will likely abandon Trump’s pro-pollution posture and go back to the auto industry with some thoughts about even more stringent emissions rules.\nThe industry wants the White House to negotiate some kind of deal with California, with the intention of creating a national standard that everyone can live with. That seems unlikely: Team Trump broke off talks with the Golden State months ago, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has rejected the idea of halfway measures.\nWatch this space.",

         "Republicans should stop fighting amnesty, President Obama said on Thursday, because one day a Hispanic will become president.\n“Over the long term, this is going to get solved, because at some point there’s going to be a President Rodriguez or there’s going to be a President Chen,” Obama told a Florida International University town hall audience, hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC.\n“The country is a nation of immigrants, and ultimately it will reflect who we are and its politics are going to reflect who we are,” Obama continued, implying that neither native-born Americans or legal immigrants have moral standing to determine who enters and stays in the country.\nHispanic foreigners attending the town hall — Fox News Latino did not say whether they were legal or illegal aliens — told Obama they feared that federal Judge Andrew Hansen’s stay on Obama’s executive order will force them to return to their home countries. (Fox News Latino incorrectly identifies Hansen as a Texas judge.)\nThe five million illegal aliens covered by Obama’s executive order could also cash in on as much as $35,000 in taxpayer handouts. That’s a minimum $175 million cost to American taxpayers for the first year alone, not counting the massive strain the low-income, poorly-educated, gang-prone aliens with high rates of illegitimacy and untreated diseases will place on the country’s medical and social institutions.\nObama’s claim that “history” was on his side is arguably false. The massive, historically unprecedented wave of immigrants crashing across the U.S. southern border is a political phenomenon, set in motion by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and accelerated by the Obama administration’s disastrous Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\nThe explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.\nEach year, four million Americans seeking jobs turn 18. In 2012, almost six million Americans graduated from college, saddled with an average $27,000 in student loan debt — $8,000 less than the handouts available for illegals presently in the country.\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.",

         "Doctor's pro-vaccine TikTok went viral. Then came hate and threats from around the world\nCINCINNATI – Nicole Baldwin, a pediatrician working in suburban Cincinnati, posted a TikTok video encouraging vaccination on Twitter Saturday evening.\nIt took less than 24 hours for the video to go viral on both TikTok, a video sharing app, and Twitter – and just another 48 hours before Baldwin was facing backlash from hundreds of thousands of people associated with the anti-vaccine movement.\nThe video shows Baldwin dancing to \"Cupid Shuffle\" and pointing to diseases that vaccines prevent. It ends with her pointing to the words \"Vaccines don't cause autism.\"\nBaldwin, 42, sees social media as a useful way to spread public health information to her patients. She maintains an active presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest, and runs a blog with tips on keeping parents and children well. The Blue Ash, Ohio pediatrician said she created her TikTok account last week because she wanted to reach a different demographic than she does with her other accounts.\n\"Obviously, as a pediatrician, I know that vaccines are safe. And I think there's a lot of misconception out there about them,\" Baldwin told The Enquirer. \"I know TikTok has this huge adolescent population as well as some younger adults, so my hope was to spread, you know, that vaccines are safe – spread that message to a different audience than what I'd reached on other social media.\"\nHealth news: A North Carolina teen was healthy and athletic. The flu killed her in days\nMeasles: Cases in the U.S. just hit a 25-year record high. Here's what you need to know\nThe anti-vaccine movement made headlines last spring, when widespread distrust of the pharmaceutical industry and the belief that vaccines can lead to autism in children led to a measles outbreak.\nThere is no link between vaccines and autism, studies have repeatedly shown.\nCommenters across Baldwin’s social media platforms insulted her, referred to vaccines as “poison” and suggested Baldwin was being paid to promote vaccination. One commenter wrote, “Dead doctors don’t lie.” People then flocked to her Yelp and Google Review pages, leaving one-star reviews in an attempt to sabotage Baldwin’s ratings.\n“I think in this day and age, Google reviews and Yelp reviews are king,” Baldwin told The Enquirer. “And I think that that is the goal for a lot of these people: to hurt my livelihood, to damage my reputation because I believe something different than they do. And it is frightening.”\nBy Tuesday, people started calling Baldwin’s practice and harassing the staff. When a woman called on Wednesday threatening to “shut the practice down,” the office had to call the police. Deerfield Township police, where Baldwin has a satellite office, said they're investigating.\nBaldwin reached out to Todd Wolynn, a colleague she had met a couple of months earlier at an event in Columbus and CEO of a pediatric practice in Pittsburgh. Wolynn had dealt with his own intense online backlash from the anti-vaccine movement two years prior and started the organization Shots Heard Round the World as a result.\nThat group's mission is to help health care professionals fight off globally coordinated attacks from the anti-vaccine movement. The attacks leveled at Baldwin were the largest the organization has seen since they launched their website for health care providers to report an attack in September.\nVaccines: A super-vaccine for the flu is being marketed to people 65 and older\n“This is a global issue,” Wolynn told The Enquirer. “As with what you see in Nicole’s case, the people that attack aren’t the people in your neighborhood, they’re from all over the world. A good doctor doesn’t have time to both see patients and do crisis communications, so that’s where we can help.”\nMany physicians who endure this kind of backlash to a post about vaccinations eventually have to take their post down out of concern that their online ratings will go down and they'll lose potential patients, Wolynn said.\n\"Hospitals are businesses. They live and die by the ratings and the reviews,\" Wolynn said. \"The issue here is that people’s health is at stake.\"\nShots Heard has a closed Facebook group for volunteers to coordinate responses to anti-vaccine attacks. Wolynn refers to these coordinations as \"informal activations\" of the network and says the organization has helped coordinate over 50 responses to this kind of incident.\nFor more large-scale attacks, such as what the backlash against Baldwin's post grew into, Shots Heard triggers a \"formal activation,\" meaning an email is sent out to the entire volunteer network.\nBaldwin ended up with 11 people volunteering their services to monitor her social media pages and prevent the spread of inaccurate information about vaccines. By Thursday morning, the volunteers had banned over 5,000 anti-vaccine accounts on Facebook and the angry calls to Baldwin's office had slowed. By Friday afternoon, Google Reviews had removed all fraudulent reviews of Baldwin's practice.\n\"When the bullies get pushback, they dissipate,\" Wolynn said. \"They’d rather go after people who don’t have help and have to try to defend themselves.\"\nBaldwin says the experience won't stop her from trying to get out the message that vaccines are safe.\n\"There will be more TikToks to come,\" Baldwin said.",

         "More in-person voting sites in metro areas. Better information about where polls have been relocated. More public education about how to vote from home and what to do if an absentee ballot doesn’t arrive—or arrives at the last minute. And no last-minute government decisions that confuse voters and undermine voting, such as imposing curfews before the polls close.\nThese are some of the takeaways from the nine presidential primaries that took place on June 2, the largest day of voting across America since the pandemic broke in mid-March, where most of the states and the District of Columbia responded by shifting to voting with mailed-out ballots rather than voting centered on local polling places as in previous elections.\nThe approaches taken in these states and districts varied and reflected the trends seen across the United States. Montana and Maryland mailed ballots to voters. Washington, D.C., and four states sent voters applications to get a mail-in ballot. Pennsylvania and Indiana left it up to voters to apply for an absentee ballot, get the ballots on time, and submit it on time to be counted.\nThe results were a spectrum of well-run to more-problematic elections. Montana, which is used to voting by mail, had higher turnout than its 2018 fall midterm. But many voters who were not used to voting from home, especially in metro areas, did not get ballots as expected. They went to vote in person, but often found traditional polling places closed. They ended up in long lines and sometimes faced hours-long waits, where social distancing could be challenging, and, in the worst case—in Washington—police were telling voters to go home because of a curfew.\nThese trends, both better and worse, offer lessons and warning signs for the fall’s elections.\n“Overall, this is a dry run for November,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which runs the nation’s largest Election Day hotline and fielded more than 5,000 calls for the primaries. “We’re bracing for high turnout that we will see in the November general election, and lessons learned from this primary season must guide states… to ensure that every eligible voter can have their voice heard.”\n“It is clear that the pandemic is having an impact on virtually every aspect of the voting experience,” she said, noting that impact was apart from a curfew in Washington that was announced by a text alert on Election Day that “did not have an exception making it clear that voters can, indeed, continue to travel to cast their ballot.”\nVoting in quasi-militarized settings was not confined to the nation’s capital. In Philadelphia, on election eve, the mayor announced a curfew that was slated to take effect an hour before its polls closed, but subsequently delayed it after an outcry by other city officials and activists. The curfews, which have never before occurred on an Election Day in recent times, were a response to looting that occurred after generally peaceful protests against police violence and racism. However, the curfews also come in a climate where the Republican Party, led by President Trump, has been repeatedly making false claims that voting by mail is rife with fraud.\n“This is simply not true,” wrote the National Vote at Home Institute’s Amber McReynolds and MIT’s Charles Stewart III, both experts, for the Hill. They noted that the right-wing Heritage Foundation’s oft-cited election fraud database listed 204 cases and 143 convictions using mailed ballots in the past 20 years, where “about 250 million votes have been cast by a mail ballot.” That activity level is “about five times less likely than getting hit by lightning in the United States.”\nBut while partisan propaganda about voting by mail is only likely to increase as the general election nears, the nuts-and-bolts challenges of shifting to voting by mail in states that have not widely instituted that process is very much a work in progress. In that sense, the statewide and district primaries on June 2, as well as dozens of elections that will be held now through the summer, are microcosms of what is working and what needs to be fixed for the fall.\nA Spectrum of States\nThe June 2 primaries featured jurisdictions with more and less experience running mail-based elections. On the most experienced side, Montana, where the senior statewide election official is a Republican, continued its practice of mailing all voters a ballot. More people voted for its 2020 primary than during the state’s November 2018 midterms.\n“Sixty-three percent of active registered voters,” said Phil Keisling, the National Vote at Home Institute’s board chair and former Oregon secretary of state. “That’s higher than 41 states in their midterms in 2018. That’s the power of mailing everyone a ballot.”\nWhile Montana was an example of how voter turnout will increase in states where voters have become used to voting from home, the experience in Midwestern and Eastern states that have not embraced voting from home until the pandemic was rockier was a different story—and not just because of the pandemic’s social distancing requirements or police presence due to widespread protests.\nIn Pennsylvania’s largest cities, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in Washington, D.C., in Baltimore, Maryland, and in Indianapolis, Indiana, election officials underestimated the number of people who sought to vote in person for any number of reasons: from not getting a mail-in ballot; to getting a ballot late and wanting to drop it off; to simply wanting to vote in a polling place.\nWhile Pennsylvania’s top officials reported a “smooth election amid historic circumstances” as 1.8 million residents applied for an absentee ballot, “17 times greater than the number who applied” in its 2016 presidential primary, voting rights advocates manning election-protection hotlines observed a different experience. The Lawyers’ Committee said that 55 percent of the calls received on June 2 were from Pennsylvania—and from people unable to vote by mail.\nHalf of the hotline calls concerned finding a polling place, the Committee’s Lacy Crawford said. Another 17 percent concerned ballots—meaning unfamiliarity with mailed-out ballots versus polling place voting. Another 13 percent concerned voter registration. Of slightly less than half of the callers who reported their race, 63 percent were Black, 21 percent were white and 12 percent were Latino.\nThe takeaway from the committee briefings, where its partners summarized what they were hearing from hundreds of observers, underscored that accommodating the fall’s voters will mean planning for high levels of voting from home—but still significant in-person voting at precincts. That conclusion is what emerges after hearing detailed reports of snafus.\n“The big theme of the day is confusion,” said Ivan Garcia, civic engagement director for MakeTheRoadPA.org. “Voters are turning up to their old polling place and not always finding directions to the consolidated poll place that they should be going to. Because of the large number of voters at each poll, poll workers are having trouble finding voters in the poll books—if they even have the poll books. In the worst situations, they are being turned down and turned away so that they cannot vote.”\nGarcia also said that many voters had not received a mail-in ballot—even though they said they had applied. When they turned up at vote centers, some poll workers were unfamiliar with the procedures to let them vote. (In some states, poll workers can look up that voter in an electronic poll book and cancel their mail-in ballot, allowing them to vote with a regular ballot. In other states, they must fill out a form to get a provisional ballot.)\n“We are seeing voters who requested mail-in ballots who never received them,” he said. “They are turning out to their polling place to vote. And instead of voting provisionally, which is what is supposed to happen, they are being turned away as well. There have been lots of phone calls asking about the clarification about the deadlines for returning mail ballots based on the executive order that Gov. [Tom] Wolf signed yesterday [June 1]. The length of the lines is increasing as we get to the end of the day. There’s been problems in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.”\nIn Indianapolis, election officials also underestimated the number of in-person voters.\n“One thing we learned from our colleagues in Indiana is that even in these challenging circumstances in the Midwest and nationally, voters have really shown a quiet resolve to persevere and to exercise their right to vote today,” said Ami Gandhi, with the committee’s Chicago chapter, which was assisted by Common Cause in Indiana. “The majority of calls we received so far are people needing clarification on where their polling place is… Some voters, especially in Indianapolis, have been facing long lines and congestion… We’re also getting many questions about absentee ballots by voters not comfortable with voting in person.”\nThese comments reflect that some voters, in response to the pandemic, clearly want to vote from home—one trend that is likely to continue into the fall’s general election. Yet, at the same time, the comments also reflect that many voters who did not get an absentee ballot, for any number of reasons, still wanted to find a way to vote in person. (This was apart from police in some locations, namely Washington, telling voters to leave because of a pending curfew.)\nMore Takeaways\nThe June 2 experience had other lessons. In Pennsylvania, where state law does not allow local election officials to start processing mail-in ballots before Election Day and the governor’s order will allow ballots postmarked by June 2 to arrive up to a week later and still be counted, the official results in some contests will not be known for days—which will recur this fall. It’s not known whether the state’s legislature will act to allow counting to start earlier in the fall.\nThere were other lessons. In Baltimore, where a contractor for the city delivered paper ballots to one district that were not properly printed, that caused a series of cascading problems that will take days to unwind—from voters casting ballots that will not count, to reconciling votes and declaring official outcomes in city races.\nThat printing error is a warning sign for states or counties that anticipate printing unprecedented volumes of paper ballots in the fall. However, because Maryland is a state offering same-day voter registration, most issues affecting voters could be solved on Election Day at in-person voting sites.\nIn Washington, one reaction to not getting ballots into voters’ hands was to email voters the ballot—to be printed at their home and then submitted. That response was quickly criticized by cybersecurity advocates, saying it offered a hacking pathway (even though some states have been sending ballots this way to soldiers stationed overseas).\nIn Philadelphia, there were also reports that the city was ignoring social distancing standards by cramming their new voting machines (one per jurisdiction) into multi-precinct voting locations, which forced voters and poll workers to stand on top of each other. There also were reports from other counties that election officials did not put ballot drop boxes in visible locations.\nStepping back, however, it appeared that apart from Montana’s 63 percent record turnout, a quarter to a third of the registered voters in states that were expanding at-home voting for the first time ended up casting mail-in ballots on June 2, according to the National Vote at Home Institute’s Keisling.\n“If we knew how many mailed-out ballots went out, you could apply an 80 percent rule—if 100,000 go out, 80,000 will come back,” he said, adding that not every state will post this information. “It varies a bit, but that’s the general rule, plus or minus 5 percent… All you need to do is look at the total votes [cast] and what’s the difference [subtracting that mail-in ballot estimate]. Those [remaining voters] are the people who showed up at a polling place.”\nIn other words, looking to the fall, record numbers of voters will be casting mail-in ballots. But sizable numbers of voters will still be looking to vote in person. Election officials will have to adequately prepare for both voting options.\nSteven Rosenfeld is the editor and chief correspondent of is the editor and chief correspondent of Voting Booth , a project of the Independent Media Institute.

         "LONDON — The coronavirus crosses borders without regard for national boundaries or identities. But the response to it, and the hunt for a vaccine, has been caught up in a tide of nationalism that was already sweeping the world before the virus hit, and may end up delaying distribution of a vaccine to billions of people.\nThis competitive vision outlined in the United States and other vaccine-producing powerhouses such as China and India threatens to undermine the efforts of dozens of countries, which are raising billions of dollars in an attempt to find an effective immunizing shot that they say should be available equally around the world.\nSome experts and former officials fear that leaders such as President Donald Trump may be pursuing the doctrine of \"vaccine nationalism.\" This is the idea that any government whose scientists win this vaccine \"race\" — as it's often described — might try to hoard the shots for domestic use.\n\"Do you believe that Trump's base will be content with a vaccine strategy that does not 'make America great again'?\" asked David Salisbury, a former director of immunization for the British Department of Health who is now an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House. \"If your country develops the vaccine before anyone else, immediately exporting it to another country is not a vote-winner.\"\nThis tension between nationalism and internationalism was illustrated at a virtual summit hosted by the European Union last week.\nDozens of countries, including Canada, Japan, Israel and Saudi Arabia, teamed up with organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in pledging $8 billion toward a global fund for vaccines, treatments and testing.\n\"This will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,\" the leaders said in a joint statement, committing to making any vaccine \"available, accessible and affordable to all.\"\nAfter a pandemic that has fragmented global supply chains, torpedoed world travel and sparked international arguments over exports of medical equipment, it was a rare moment of cross-border cooperation.\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\nBut one glaring absentee was Trump, who not only declined an invitation but failed to send any American representative at all.\nIt was far from the first time Trump has demonstrated his lack of interest in multilateralism. He has openly criticized the founding principles of NATO, branded the E.U. a competitor and slapped its goods with billions of dollars in tariffs, and once told the United Nations General Assembly that \"we reject the ideology of globalism.\"\nThis year he moved to withdraw funding from the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency, after accusing it of helping China cover up the virus in its early stages, an allegation Beijing denies.\n'China cannot afford to lose'\nChina did attend the E.U.-hosted summit, even though Premier Li Keqiang, the country's second-most powerful official, pulled out at the last minute and sent his ambassador to the E.U., Zhang Ming, instead. Some observers perceived this as a snub.\nDespite being the world's second-largest economy, China pledged around $49 million, a fraction of what was promised by many of its European counterparts — such as Norway, at $1 billion.\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\nThe most promising trial in China is funded by the government. And a far more nationalistic approach was set out in an op-ed article published by the Global Times, the country's hawkish state-run newspaper, which according to its editor publishes what Communist Party officials privately think but don't say publicly.\n\"We must be aware that the development of a vaccine is a battle that China cannot afford to lose,\" it said. \"There is no way for China to rely on Europe or the U.S. in vaccine development. China has to be by itself in this crucial field,\" it added, calling the race \"a life-and-death battle.\"\nAnother absentee at the summit was India, which is home to the world's largest vaccine producer by volume, the Serum Institute of India. Its owner, the billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, has openly said that \"a majority of the vaccine, at least initially, would have to go to our countrymen before it goes abroad.\"\nA laboratory technician researches coronavirus vaccines at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, on April 22. Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters file\nEven for those countries that did attend, it is not clear whether they would have the power to enforce their egalitarian vision in the face of nationalistic or market forces.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that any vaccine \"won't belong to anybody,\" and that those who discover it \"will be fairly paid, but access will be given to people across the globe.\"\nThis dream was given a reality check Wednesday after Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical giant and one of the leading players in the coronavirus vaccine race, told Bloomberg News that the U.S. was likely to get access before the rest of the world because it had invested more money.\nLikewise in the U.K. — which pledged more than $480 million at the teleconference — the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca said it \"will prioritize the U.K.\" if its promising trial yields results.\n\"This debate builds on a long-standing question about nationalism versus global responsibility,\" said Nancy Kass, a professor and the deputy director for public health at Johns Hopkins University's Berman Institute of Bioethics. \"And we happen to be in an extraordinarily nationalistic period right now in the United States.\"\nLike many bioethicists, Kass said it's understandable for citizens to expect first access to drugs developed and manufactured on their soil, particularly at a time of chronic anxiety.\n\"I don't think it will either be constructive or even necessarily an appropriate framing to think of this in terms of good guys and bad guys,\" she said. \"What I do think is essential is that people use this time before we have a vaccine to have this conversation.\"\n'Incalculable' value\nThere's no guarantee an effective vaccine will ever be found, and even then it could take a year or more to develop, test and distribute. Worldwide, about a dozen vaccine candidates are in the first stages of testing or poised to begin, small safety studies in people, according to the Associated Press.\n\"The social value of a safe and effective vaccine is almost incalculable — we are talking about trillions of dollars,\" said Frank Lichtenberg, a Columbia Business School professor who has spent much of his career estimating how much new medicines are worth.\n\"Drugs are usually valuable because they decrease mortality,\" he said, \"not because they have the power to stop the unemployment rate hitting 20 percent, like this one might.\"\nTrump has labeled his vaccine effort \"Operation Warp Speed,\" spending hundreds of millions of dollars co-funding efforts by companies such as the Boston-based Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, based in New Jersey.\nJohnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky has said his company is committed to coming up with a not-for-profit vaccine that is \"available and affordable globally as quickly as possible.\"\nCobra Biologics, in Keele, Britain, is one of 90-plus projects working on immunizing shots. Carl Recine / Reuters file\nAnd even Trump himself said in March that \"I don't care\" when asked if he worried about another country beating the U.S. in the inoculation race.\n\"I just want to get a vaccine that works. If it’s another country, I’ll take my hat off to them,\" he said, \"We’re working with other countries, we're working with Australia, we’re working with the U.K.\"\nBut the Department of Health and Human Services was clear in a statement March 30 that domestic use would take priority, and that the initial goal was to make a \"COVID-19 vaccine available for emergency use in the United States in early 2021.\"\nThe vaccine world has been here before. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, wealthy countries put in advanced orders for the H1N1 flu vaccine, essentially crowding out poorer countries who had to wait longer to get access to the shots.\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\nHowever, in this unprecedented situation, where a vaccine could prevent a country's economic collapse, governments might resort to more desperate measures. One tactic might be to ignore patents covering the drugs and manufacture them without consent, according to Søren Holm, a professor of bioethics at the University of Manchester, in England.\nThat's what South Africa did with HIV/AIDS medicine in the 1990s, ultimately forcing drug companies into a humiliating climbdown in which they licensed the medication at a lower price.\n\"It showed that these types of threats tend to work,\" Holm said.\nUltimately, whoever wins the race, the U.S. is unlikely to find itself shut out.\n\"If the vaccine is discovered somewhere else, then I'm sure that the U.S. will tell that pharmaceutical firm that they have to sell to them as well,\" Holm added. \"The U.S. is by far the most important market for any large pharmaceutical firm, so it would be commercial suicide for any firm to tell America they have to wait.\"",

         "From soccer games to marathons, concerns about coronavirus have led sports organizers to cancel or modify major events across the globe. With more than 80,000 reported cases of the disease, the viral outbreak continues to create uncertainty about future competitions, from track and field and Formula 1 to the ultimate global event, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nLast Sunday’s Tokyo Marathon, usually one of the largest in the world, went ahead with just 200 elite athletes and a request from organizers for spectators to stay home. The Hong Kong Marathon, scheduled for Feb. 9, was canceled; and the World Indoor Track and Field Championships, set for March 13-15 in Nanjing, China, have been postponed until next year.\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\nFor professional athletes whose bodies are their businesses, health is a top priority. As the epidemic spreads, more and more athletes are forced to weigh a potential threat against the financial loss of missing a competition.\n“You’re going to get a lot of different answers,” said Chris Layne, managing director of Total Sports US, which represents some of the world’s top track and field athletes. “If you have an athlete at the pinnacle of their career, both in earnings and performance, maybe they can afford to miss an event versus someone fighting to get to that point.”\nTrack and field athletes don’t typically earn the lucrative salaries seen in the NBA, NFL, tennis or international soccer. The biggest shot for these athletes to make money lies in prizes and sponsorship deals. To earn either, you have to participate in events. That makes the impact of a missed event more significant, according to Layne.\n“If you do six events and say you earn $500, that $3,000 lets you keep performing,” he said. “Track and field is really a global sport in terms of events so it could snowball with an athlete losing six, seven, eight times to compete and make a name for themselves. You could be taking away a season’s worth of earning potential.”\nOne of the bigger sponsorship opportunities for track and field athletes lies in the Olympics, which provide nearly unparalleled exposure. But if coronavirus continues to be a threat, the decision about whether to risk competing could be out of athletes’ hands.\nDick Pound, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee, said a decision about whether to proceed with holding the event would need to be made by late May. If the coronavirus isn’t contained by that point, Pound said cancellation could be a possibility.\nFor now, the IOC isn’t planning to cancel the Games, which have dealt with potential health threats in the recent past. There were concerns about bird flu ahead of the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, Zika during the 2016 Rio Olympics, and swine flu before the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nA Catholic priest in Rhode Island who barred state lawmakers who supported an abortion rights bill from receiving communion at his church has doubled down on his stance, saying abortion is worse than pedophilia.\nIn an interview over the weekend with NBC affiliate WJAR in Providence, the Rev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick described abortion as \"the slaughter of innocent children.\"\n\"We are not talking about any other moral issue, where some may make it a comparison between pedophilia and abortion,\" Bucci told the station. \"Pedophilia doesn't kill anyone, and this does.\"\nBucci said more children have been killed by abortion than have been abused, adding, \"which is not to say that abuse is not a horrible thing.\"\nSacred Heart Church declined to comment Wednesday, deferring to Bucci. NBC News reached out to Bucci for comment but did not immediately hear back. He later told WJAR his comments were taken out of context and that if anyone supports clergy sex abuse victims, it's him.\n\"It was imperfectly said,\" Bucci said. \"I should have said, 'In general, the child that's molested does not die physically,' and I should have said, 'but some have.'\"\nLet our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha\nRev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church in West Warwick, R.I. WJAR\nBucci's earlier comments to the TV station came after he put out a notice to Sacred Heart parishioners at the end of January listing the names of lawmakers who would not be allowed to receive communion at the church or participate in certain religious functions, such as acting as godparents or lectors at weddings.\nThe announcement came days after the Jan. 22 anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 establishing the right to abortion.\nThe priest's action also came months after Rhode Island in 2019 enacted the Reproductive Privacy Act to enshrine the right to abortion in state law.\nThe secretary of Sacred Heart Church provided a copy of the flyer to NBC News. Lawmakers' names appeared below the message:\n\"In accord with the teaching of the Catholic Church for 2000 years, the following members of the legislature may not receive Holy Communion, as are all the officers of the state of Rhode Island, as well as Rhode Island’s members of Congress. In addition, they will not be allowed to act as witnesses to marriage, godparents, or lectors at weddings, funerals or any other church function.”\nBucci discussed this announcement in an interview with the Providence Journal.\n“If they are proud of what they have done, why do they want to keep it a secret?\" he said of lawmakers. \"We all hear about responsibility. Let them take responsibility. If they think this is a good and wholesome and holy thing ... they should be proud of it, and why should I hide that from my parishioners?\"\nProvidence Bishop Thomas Tobin issued a statement Thursday, saying, \"It is never acceptable to underestimate the harm caused by sexual abuse of minors,\" but \"abortion is also a sinful, immoral act, an abominable crime.”\n\"In the current public discussion, I urge all parties to refrain from unhelpful, inflammatory rhetoric, and to reflect personally and prayerfully on the consequences of these grave matters,\" Tobin said.\nOn Monday, a diocese spokeswoman, Carolyn Cronin, told WJAR that the church provides \"detailed norms for preparation and reception\" for each sacrament, but that it is \"the pastor’s duty to apply them within his parish, in accord with church law.\"\n\"Because the church entrusts to each pastor the duty of teaching, sanctifying, and governing his parish, the daily pastoral and administrative decisions are made at the local parish level,\" Cronin said.",

But some questionable claims about COVID-19 have also appeared online, and the Daily Beast’s Dean Sterling Jones notes that some of them have come from the controversial psychiatrist Kelly Brogan — known for her association with actress Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.\nAccording to Jones, Brogan (an anti-vaxxer) has been “spreading discredited pseudo-scientific claims that the coronavirus might not even exist” and that “symptoms attributed to the virus are likely being caused by widespread fear.” Brogan’s assertions, Jones notes, can be found in a video recently posted on Facebook and Instagram.\nJones explains, “In the video, which was originally shared with paid subscribers of Brogan’s ‘health reclamation’ program, Vital Life Project, and has since been viewed over 75,000 times online, Brogan claimed that ‘there is potentially no such thing as the coronavirus’ because ‘it’s not possible to prove that any given pathogen has induced death,’ and that the rising death toll caused by the virus is ‘likely being accelerated by the fear (of the virus) itself.’”\nJones noted that Facebook removed Brogan’s video following inquiries from the Daily Beast, and a Facebook spokesperson told the publication, “These videos violate our policies and have been removed from both Facebook and Instagram.”\nWhen the Beast contacted Goop, Jones reports, Paltrow’s company declined to comment and stated, “We would suggest reaching out to Dr. Brogan directly, as she didn’t make those comments on Goop’s platform.” And when the Beast contacted Brogan, she didn’t respond.\nBrogan has received widespread criticism in recent years for her comments against vaccination, including her claim that vaccines are linked to autism.",

         "Gadsby's work is a testament to how eagerly the arbiters of our culture will devour and elevate work that convincingly purports to be progressive.\nHannah Gadsby’s mission to rescue comedy from cruelty ends with “Douglas,” an act so immensely cruel it rises nearly to the level of torture. Gadsby, of course, is famous only because her first major special, “Nanette,” rejected the art of stand-up comedy, arguing that “punch lines need trauma” and are inherently “destructive.” Having pleased the liberal arbiters of culture, Gadsby followed her “powerful” and “transformative” rejection of stand-up with a stand-up special. “Nanette,” as it turns out, couldn’t even transform its own author.\nAre there punch lines? Well, she tries. Gadsby is convinced her jokes are both funny and transgressive, when they’re actually just transgressively unfunny. If you happen to have a few NPR tote bags in your Prius, Gadsby’s painfully dull swings at “‘Murica” and anti-vaxxers and Louis CK might have you laughing like it’s Ladies Night Out at a Kathy Griffin show and the eco-friendly chardonnay is disappearing faster than the rainforest. The humor is so trite and edgeless, I don’t even think its lacking appeal is a partisan issue—the audience for this is seriously limited, and I have a feeling most of it works in media.\nIt’s genuinely painful to watch Gadsby swipe at low-hanging fruit like she’s Christian Yelich hitting a Grand Slam. “Americans are like the straight white man of cultures,” she observes at one point, presumably cribbing the quip from the Tumblr account of a women’s studies student. To anti-vaxxers, Gadsby bravely demands, “Get a pet rock and delete your f-cking blog!,” then brushes imaginary dirt off her shoulder like she’s just knocked out Mike Tyson.\n“Douglas” starts with a 15-minute preface in which Gadsby maps out the remainder of the show, which is less of an ingenious concept and more of a lazy way to bring the set full circle, which she does, and with a decent swipe at Louis CK.\nThankfully, though, Gadsby is self-aware. “I’m part of the problem now!” the comedian happily concedes right off the bat. “If you’re here because of ‘Nanette,’ why?” Gadsby asks, later describing her “core demographic” as “rich, white, entitled women.” She claims not to mind critics labeling “Nanette” a monologue or a Ted Talk or lecture. “What the f-ck are you expecting from this show? Because I’m sorry, if it’s more trauma, I’m fresh out. Had I known just how wildly popular trauma was going to be in the context of comedy, I might have budgeted my sh-t a bit better,” Gadsby jokes.\nBut she’s not quite self-aware enough to actually, meaningfully concede that “Douglas” is a refutation of the very thesis that made her famous. The most obvious evidence is that she claimed to be quitting stand-up in “Nanette,” which she obviously understands as a contradiction. But that’s less interesting than her rejection of the “punch lines are trauma” claim, which implicated just about every major comedian and intentionally—even proudly—challenged the very bedrock of stand-up. Gadsby does not really grapple with that glaring contradiction.\n“Douglas” would never be confused with a lecture. It’s just stand-up comedy. And like most stand-up comedy, it even mines personal trauma for punch lines, the practice Gadsby herself famously condemned as “destructive” in “Nanette.” From her experiences with autism to an obviously “traumatic” anecdote about arguing and crying with a doctor, Gadsby draws punchlines out of her own trauma, despite claiming to be “fresh out” of it.\nTake this joke at the end of her anti-vaxxer bit:\nWhy I snack on hate? You’ve worked it out? It’s how you build up immunity. It’s called micro-dosing. Yeah. Your hate is my vaccine. What are you gonna do? I’ve already got autism. I have what’s called high-functioning autism, which is a terrible name for what I have, because it gives the impression that I function highly. I do not.\nCue the laughter and destruction. Gadsby dives into her experience as a woman with autism, explaining the challenges it creates through a story about frustrating an impatient teacher. The punch lines aren’t great, but they’re certainly not destructive either. That was always the problem with her argument. Comedy can heal, it can foster empathy, it can expose political hypocrisy—but it often needs to draw on trauma to do it.\nI actually enjoyed “Nanette.” I thought it was entirely wrong, but found Gadsby’s performance compelling. In “Douglas,” her concluding commentary on various works of art is smoother, more natural and funny. But Gadsby’s persona is gratingly smug, which takes exceptionally sharp writing to pull off. Telling Americans it’s “dumb in the face” to refer to petroleum as “gas” doesn’t quite hit the mark.\nGadsby herself renders the acclaim critics showered upon “Nanette” silly. The New York Times recently described “Douglas” as, “formally more complex and denser intellectually” than “Nanette.”\n“Whereas ‘Nanette’ needed to stop the comedy to make its most serious points,” writes Jason Zinoman, “Gadsby works hard to blend the two here, and the result is an intricate, heady show whose cleverness gets in its own way.” That, of course, is why the central argument of “Nanette” failed. Maybe Gadsby knew that all along. Maybe she liked the sound of her argument more than she cared about its legitimacy.\nIn the end, it was all a rhetorical exercise, a flexing of intellectual muscles that fizzled when the time for real-world application unexpectedly knocked on Gadsby’s door. “Douglas” is a testament to “Nanette’s” failure. It’s a testament to how eagerly the arbiters of our culture will devour and elevate work that convincingly purports to be progressive—and a testament to how easy it is to convince them.\n“Douglas” will help you understand why Gadsby made it big only after rejecting stand-up. Perhaps she fought against punch lines because good ones elude her.",

         "While most of the world hungers for a vaccine to put an end to the death and economic destruction wrought by COVID-19, some anti-vaccine groups are joining with anti-lockdown protesters to challenge restrictions aimed at protecting public health.\nVaccine critics suffered serious setbacks in the past year, as states strengthened immunization laws in response to measles outbreaks sparked by vaccine refusers. California tightened its vaccine requirements last fall despite protests during which anti-vaccine activists threw blood on state senators, assaulted the vaccine bill’s sponsor and shut down the legislature.\nNow, many of these same vaccine critics are joining a fight against stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which had killed more than 47,000 Americans as of Thursday afternoon.\n“This is just a fresh coat of paint for the anti-vaccine movement in America, and an exploitative means for them to try to remain relevant,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\nHotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause.\n“Unfortunately, their strategy may work.”\nA group calling itself the Freedom Angels, whose members last year stood on chairs and chanted at public hearings on the California vaccine bill, say governors are abusing their power by shutting down gun shops and other businesses.\nMany anti-vaccine activists — who have claimed that diseases such as measles aren’t that serious — now contend the coronavirus isn’t dangerous enough to justify staying home. They agree with President Donald Trump that the “cure” for the pandemic could be worse than the disease itself.\nThat’s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters — whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter — in staging demonstrations in state capitals to “reopen America.”\n“This is the time for people to take notice and really evaluate the freedoms they’re giving up, all in the name of perceived safety,” said Freedom Angels co-founder Heidi Munoz Gleisner in a Facebook video.\nThe group organized a Monday rally in Sacramento called “Operation Gridlock.”\n“People need to get back to work, get back to life, get back into contact with their loved ones who they’re isolated from, they need to be able to have a paycheck,” group co-founder Tara Thornton told The Sacramento Bee, which interviewed her during the demonstration. “This is the grounds they will enslave us upon.”\nFreedom Angels did not respond to requests for interviews. The group’s website mentions plans for additional rallies and includes photos from Monday’s demonstration, such as one in which a protester holds a sign proclaiming “No Mandatory Vaccines.”\nBut after the Monday event, the California Highway Patrol announced it had revoked the group’s permit for future protests because the gathering — which included dozens of people — violated the governor’s social distancing order. The highway patrol has now banned all group events at the Capitol during the pandemic to avoid spreading the coronavirus.\nA big tent\nThe anti-vaccine movement has never been limited to one political party. Left-leaning vaccine critics — such as Children’s Health Defense, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — include environmentalists who are suspicious of chemical pollutants, corporations and “Big Pharma.” The Kennedy group’s website attacks Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for rushing “risky and uncertain coronavirus vaccines” into development as part of a “sweetheart deal” for drug companies.\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, many anti-vaccine conservatives oppose state immunization requirements because they distrust “big government.”\nA group called Texans for Vaccine Choice has called on the governor to promise that no one will be forced to get a coronavirus vaccine in order to go to work or school.\nPosts on the Facebook page of Californians for Health Choice, which also opposed California’s vaccine laws, question stay-at-home orders and accuse government officials of refusing to admit the orders are a mistake.\nIn a video on the Freedom Angels’ Facebook page, its founders describe stay-at-home orders as an abuse of government authority, and the closure of California gun shops as an assault on the Second Amendment. The group notes that guns could be essential for protection from rioters and looters looking to steal food during the pandemic.\nIn many ways, the conservative arm of the anti-vaccine movement is a natural ally for those leading “reopen America” rallies, said Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist and managing editor of the Science-Based Medicine site. Both harbor suspicions about government authority.\nVaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said. Trump has at times linked vaccines with autism, although he came out strongly in favor of vaccinations during the 2019 measles epidemic.\nAnti-vaccine groups are now rebranding themselves as advocates of “medical freedom.”\nProtests against social distancing began in Michigan but have spread to state capitols in Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Maryland, Wisconsin and elsewhere, with more planned. Most protests have been small, limited to a few hundred or fewer people.\nYet the anti-vaccine movement doesn’t speak for everyone on the right.\nStephen Moore, the senior economic contributor for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group that has been helping publicize the protests, said he’s unfamiliar with the Freedom Angels or their rallies.\n“I’m personally pro-vaccine,” said Moore, a member of the White House council to reopen the economy. “Especially when it comes to coronavirus.”\nAnd some heroes of the anti-vaccine movement say they support coronavirus lockdowns.\nDr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica, California, pediatrician popular among vaccine foes for downplaying the risks of measles, said the risk of COVID-19 is real. Gordon said he approves of the lockdown, “and we have to keep it up.”\nContaining the pandemic\nDr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and California state senator who has championed stronger vaccine mandates, described anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters as “essentially selfish” because they put other people at risk.\n“One of the hallmarks of the anti-vaccine movement is this sense of selfishness and lack of concern for other people’s health,” Pan said. “They like to talk about rights and freedom. But what they really want is freedom without consequences.”\nBoth anti-vaccine parents and those who want to relax social distancing assume that the medical system will come to their rescue if they become sick, said Pan, who noted that thousands of health care workers have died while fighting the pandemic.\nFauci has said that relaxing stay-at-home orders is dangerous as long as the virus — for which there are no approved treatments or vaccines — is actively spreading. Reopening businesses too soon could spark a second wave of infections.\nMore than 75 companies and research groups worldwide are trying to develop vaccines, which are seen as a key weapon against the novel coronavirus.\nIn the meantime, the CDC says that social distancing measures — such as working from home and avoiding large gatherings — are critical to slowing the spread of the coronavirus and preventing patients from overwhelming hospitals. Health leaders say it won’t be safe to reopen the county until widespread testing shows the coronavirus has died down.\nAmericans overwhelmingly support vaccination, according to surveys, and polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 80% of Americans want lockdowns to continue. Only 19% said social distancing orders placed an unnecessary burden on the economy. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\nNeither the anti-vaccine nor anti-lockdown demonstrators represent the opinions of most Americans, Pan said.\n“Let’s put this movement into proper context,” he said. “They’re loud, they’re noisy and they’re small.”",

         "Thanks to abortion, America is whiter than it would be if all those babies were allowed to live. If pro-lifers had their way, the United States would be blacker and browner than it is today.\nAnother day, another pro-lifer smeared as a racist. In August, it was Catholic author J.D. Vance, whom a Washington Post writer tried to tar with the r-word, only to fall flat when it was revealed that she misrepresented what Vance said and failed to note that his wife and son are Indian American. This time around, it is Episcopalian Tucker Carlson, accused by Farhad Manjoo in Sunday’s New York Times of “advancing ethnonationalist populism” and worse.\nLike some falsehoods, this latest has a kernel of truth: The Fox News host is a “populist.” But the magical-thinking leap from populism to racism, which is now de rigueur in such hit pieces, crashes and burns. Manjoo’s charge is drawn mostly from a staffer at uber-woke Media Matters, whose job, apparently, is to watch Fox News and follow social media. White nationalists, reports Manjoo ominously, quoting the Media Matters researcher, “look at [Tucker] as a thought leader and an influential thinker.”\nSo? Whatever else you make of him, that’s what Carlson is. Anyone within reach of a television could say the same, from Antifa members to fans of “Stranger Things.” If we’re really going to talk about racism, let’s ask a more interesting question than any in the New York Times piece: Who, exactly, thinks that adding more brown and black people to the world is a good thing — and who doesn’t?\n‘Family Planning’ Means Reducing Minorities\nWhether it means to or not, team left amounts to keeping the world a whiter place. Recall Bernie Sanders’ recent open fretting about “overpopulation” and the need for more birth control in the “poor countries.” On any short list of those nations — say, the poorest 20 — almost all lie in Africa. To well-off, aging, lefty Westerners, more young Africans amounts to a problem.\nOn the global, liberal left, that same preoccupation with Africans and their fertility is endemic. In July 2017, childless French President Emmanuel Macron worried at an appearance in Germany over the “civilizational” challenges facing Africa, singling out the fact that women in some countries still have “seven or eight children.” Elsewhere that same summer, Canada’s minister of international development, Marie-Claude Bibeau, called abortion “a tool to end poverty.” En route to a “family planning” meeting in Rwanda, she was not speaking of Canadians.\nThe forward-looking Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is another powerful institution, the resources of which, whatever the intentions behind them, will have the effect of bringing fewer African babies into the world. Which, exactly, are the families that apparently need to be “planned” — a euphemism for “reduced,” since “family planning” never includes family expansion? Check the faces on the relevant section of the website. They do not resemble Icelanders or Finns.\nIt isn’t only the prospect of more Africans that summons anxiety in some places. In 2009, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a slip akin to Macron’s, when she said in an interview with New York Times Magazine that “at the time Roe was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of.” She didn’t mean descendants of those who sailed on the Mayflower.\nPro-Lifers Would Bless the World with Brown Babies\nSo returning to our original question: Who, exactly, doesn’t think bringing more brown and black humans into the world is a problem?\nOne contender is the Catholic Church. Pope Francis just concluded a tour of several countries on the continent, tacitly affirming what everyone who can count already knows: The future of Christianity lies in Africa. It’s in tradition-minded Africa that Christianity has grown explosively during these last decades. African priests and ministers are now routinely being exported to the United States, to re-evangelize the descendants of the people who first evangelized them.\nThe pro-life movement isn’t for keeping down the numbers of brown and black people, either. In such circles — and only in such circles — the fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned. The pro-life Lozier Institute, among others, keeps steady track of disparities such as these: “In 2016, as in previous years, more African American babies were aborted than were born alive in New York City.” Outside the pro-life movement, this racial disparity garners not a peep, including from people who accuse others of promoting “whiteness.”\nSay what you like about pro-lifers, including Carlson, but they don’t think whitening up the country is a good thing. That’s why white nationalists, who are enthusiasts for the abortion of black and brown people, despise pro-lifers, as anyone reporting in good faith should know. It’s also why attempts to portray pro-lifers as racists smack of disingenuousness.\nHere’s an irony: Thanks to Roe, America is a whiter place than it would otherwise have become. If pro-lifers had had their way, on the other hand, America would be considerably blacker and browner than it is today. So do the thought experiment: Which result might a real supremacist like more?",

         "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s response to U.S. protests over racism and police misconduct, vowing to try to heal the country’s racial divide and not “fan the flames of hate.”\nSpeaking in Philadelphia – a city rocked by sometimes violent demonstrations in recent days – the former vice president sought to draw a vivid contrast between himself and Trump, whom he will face in the Nov. 3 general election.\nBiden, who served eight years as vice president under Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, cast himself as the candidate who best understands the longstanding pain and grief in the country’s black communities.\nHe said the killing of George Floyd, the African-American man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police last week, was a “wake-up call” for the nation that must force it to address the stain of systemic racism.\n“We can’t leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away and do nothing,” Biden said. “We can’t.”\nHe accused Trump, a Republican, of turning the nation into “a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears.”\n“Is this who we want to be?” he asked. “Is this what we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren? Fear, anger, finger pointing, rather than the pursuit of happiness? Incompetence and anxiety, self-absorption, selfishness?”\nBiden was particularly critical of Trump’s visit on Monday to a historic church across from the White House, which was preceded by law enforcement authorities dispersing a crowd near the church with smoke canisters and flash grenades.\n“We can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” said Biden, who accused Trump of “serving the passions” of his conservative base at the expense of the rest of the country.\nDemocratic U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden arrives with U.S. Secret Service agents to speak at an event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. June 2, 2020. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\nBiden pledged he would “not traffic in fear or division.”\nBiden, 77, has been under pressure from young African-Americans and other progressives to aggressively address racial and economic inequities in the country - and he has been increasingly talking in terms of sweeping societal change.\nHis long history in the Senate, where he authored a now-heavily criticized crime bill in the 1990s, has at times complicated that effort, sowing some mistrust among activists.\nAt the same time, he has been mindful of condemning the looting and violence that has marked some of the protests.\nTrump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson accused Biden in a statement after the speech of making “the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.”\nTrump on Monday called the violence at the protests “acts of domestic terror” and threatened to deploy the U.S. military to secure the nation’s cities.\nBiden’s speech on Tuesday at Philadelphia’s City Hall marked the first time he has left his home state of Delaware since mid-March, when the outbreak of the novel coronavirus forced him to halt in-person campaigning.\nWhile Biden had made public appearances in Delaware in recent days and convened a virtual conference of big-city mayors on Monday, Tuesday’s speech suggested he may soon begin to again move about the country as states slowly re-open.\nBiden formally launched his White House bid in Philadelphia last year, and it’s where his campaign headquarters - currently empty because of the pandemic - is located.\nSlideshow (8 Images)\nGRAPHIC: Who is running in 2020 - here\nThe city was also the birthplace of the U.S. Constitution, which Biden cited in his speech as support of the right to peacefully protest.\n“Our freedom to speak is the cherished knowledge that lives inside every American,” he said.",

         "Young women taking part in high school and college athletics across the country have had their dreams of winning dashed by the movement to allow biological male who “identify” as female to compete against them.\nThe non-profit Christian legal group Alliance for Defending Freedom, which is representing three of these female athletes in the state of Connecticut, recently posted a video to illustrate what it is like to lose — not in a race against the best of your peers but against a runner whose biological sex gives him an innate advantage.\nThe headline of the recent blog post on ADF’s website says: This Video Shows Why We Must Protect Women’s Sports in Idaho and Beyond.\nThe title refers to the only state so far that has successfully pushed back against the transgender athletics movement by passing the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, signed into law by Idaho Gov. Brad Little on March 30.\nThe video is the from the pre-coronavirus Big Sky Conference Championship held in February of this year. It shows biological girls and one transgender girl in the 1-mile race.\nMaureen Collins wrote a blog about the video for ADF:\nWhy shouldn’t males be permitted to compete in women’s sports? Well, I could answer this by explaining the physiological differences between males and females. I could talk about how males are generally physically stronger and faster than females and have more muscle and a greater bone density and lung capacity. I could argue that whenever a male is permitted to compete against females, that likely means women will be displaced from the podium and even miss out on opportunities to compete altogether. But this isn’t surprising when you learn that this athlete is a male, who is unfairly allowed to compete in the female category by NCAA policies. Unfortunately, this isn’t an isolated incident. Across the country, female athletes are being forced to compete against males. It’s happening in Connecticut, where the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference allows males to compete in high school women’s athletics. As a result, two male athletes have taken 15 women’s state championship titles previously held by nine individual girls!\nADF’s website also explains its support for the trio of female runners in Connecticut:\nEver since the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference adopted a policy that allows males who identify as female to compete in girls’ athletic events, boys have consistently deprived Selina Soule, Alanna Smith, and Chelsea Mitchell of honors and opportunities to compete at elite levels. Mitchell, for example, would have won the 2019 state championship in the women’s 55-meter indoor track competition, but because two males took first and second place, she was denied the gold medal. Soule and Smith likewise have been denied medals and/or advancement opportunities. The complaint filed in Soule v. Connecticut Association of Schools with the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut explains that CIAC’s new policy and others like it pose a concrete threat to Title IX gains because “inescapable biological facts of the human species [are] not stereotypes, ‘social constructs,’ or relics of past discrimination. As a result of these many inherent physiological differences between men and women after puberty, male athletes consistently achieve records 10-20% higher than comparably fit and trained women across almost all athletic events, with even wider consistent disparities in long-term endurance events and contests of sheer strength such as weight-lifting.”\n“In track-and-field events that do not use equipment, the physiological differences between males and females after puberty are stark in the record books,” the complaint says. “No one doubts that top male and female high school athletes are equally committed to excelling in their sport, and train equally hard. Yet boys and men consistently run faster and jump higher and farther than girls and women.”\n“Girls deserve to compete on a level playing field. Forcing them to compete against boys isn’t fair, shatters their dreams, and destroys their athletic opportunities,” ADF Legal Counsel Christiana Holcomb said in an article posted on ADF’s website. “Having separate boys’ and girls’ sports has always been based on biological differences, not what people believe about their gender, because those differences matter for fair competition. And forcing girls to be spectators in their own sports is completely at odds with Title IX, a federal law designed to create equal opportunities for women in education and athletics. Connecticut’s policy violates that law and reverses nearly 50 years of advances for women.”\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter",

         "(Reuters Health) - Hispanic Americans may experience worsening mental health when immigration arrests spike, a U.S. study suggests.\nResearchers examined data on people who identified as Hispanic or Latino in nationally-representative behavioral health surveys administered from 2014 to 2018. Overall, more than one third of these participants reported at least one day of poor mental health in the previous month, and about 11% reported frequent mental distress.\nDuring the study period, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made 440,601 arrests, the study team notes in the American Journal of Public Health. Arrests increased sharply after a series of anti-immigration executive orders in 2017 that authorized a border wall with Mexico, banned U.S. entry for people from several predominantly Muslim countries, and modified ICE policies around arrests and deportation.\nChanges in arrest rates varied by state. But each 1-percentage point increase in a state’s immigration arrest rate following these immigration policy changes was associated with significantly worse mental health outcomes for Hispanic people in the study.\n“Given that immigration policy continues to be a deeply contested topic, ensuring that the health and social consequences of aggressive enforcement are identified and acknowledged within national debates is a key priority,” study authors Emilie Bruzelius of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York City and Aaron Baum of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City write.\nICE has arrested more than 2 million immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. since 2008, the researchers note. Some previous research suggests that immigration-related anxiety could have a detrimental impact on mental health, particularly among racial/ethnic groups that have been disproportionately targeted for arrest and deportation.\nUnder current immigration policies, it’s possible that immigration arrests could lead to poor mental health by increasing deportation fears among undocumented individuals and their families and neighbors, the study authors write. People from populations targeted by these immigration policies might also experience more discrimination, which worsens mental health.\nAcross the entire study period, participants reported an average of 3.62 days of poor mental health during the previous month.\nWhen researchers looked only at the 2017 shift in immigration policies, they didn’t find these policies to be associated with changes in mental health.\nBut when they looked at both the 2017 policy shifts and changes in arrest rates, they found states that had bigger spikes in arrest rates also had larger increases in the number of poor mental health days. These states also had bigger increases in the proportion of people reporting any days of poor mental health or frequent mental distress.\nCompared to the period before the immigration policy shifts, a 1-percentage point increase in arrest rates after a policy shift was associated with a 14% higher risk of frequent mental distress and an 11% higher risk of any indications of poor mental health.\nThe study can’t prove that policy changes or arrest rates might directly impact mental health. Another limitation is that researchers lacked data on whether individual participants had experienced discrimination or were aware of immigration arrests or impacted personally by the policy changes.\nThe researchers also couldn’t account for any connection between changes in state-level immigration arrests and the proportion of undocumented residents.\n“Additional research and, more important, public health action are urgently needed to mitigate the damaging effects of intensified anti-immigration enforcement measures and restrictive immigration policies on health,” the researchers conclude.\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2KIFKkA American Journal of Public Health, online October 17, 2019.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\nEL CINCHADO, Guatemala — Less-organized migrants, tighter immigration control by Guatemalan authorities and the presence of U.S. advisers have reduced the likelihood that the hundreds of migrants who departed Honduras will form anything like the cohesive procession the term “caravan” now conjures.\nWhat awaits them along their journey has changed dramatically. Guatemalan officials are checking documents, Mexico's National Guard has been deployed and if the migrants make it to the U.S. border, officials there will make them await their asylum cases in Mexico or send them to another country in the region they're fleeing to apply for protection there.\nThe migrants who set out from a bus terminal in the northern Honduras city of San Pedro Sula early Wednesday quickly dispersed depending on their luck catching rides and the border crossing they were targeting.\nFor days, a rallying call for a new caravan circulated on social media. But the turnout, while large, did not compare to caravans of 2018 that drew the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nCaravans have tended to attract migrants with fewer resources — not enough money to pay a smuggler — and offer a greater level of security than traveling alone or in small groups.\nMigrants interviewed said they knew of no plan to regroup along the way and form a caravan. Most were clustered along highways walking in groups of 20 or so.\nGuatemalan Red Cross paramedics attends Honduran migrants before they are deported, in Morales, Guatemala on Jan. 16, 2020. Moises Castillo / AP\nThe Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. This site is protected by recaptcha\nWalter Martínez joined those assembled in San Pedro Sula because he figured it would be safer to travel with others. When he migrated the first time five years ago, his family paid for a smuggler. The now 18-year-old lived in Houston until he was deported in November.\nReturning to Honduras gave him a chance to see his mother for the first time in years, but he found he knew almost no one else. He had been traveling all day Wednesday with a single mother and her baby who he met in San Pedro Sula. They were spending the night at a small shelter in Entre Rios about 15 miles into Guatemala.\n“I didn't tell my little brothers because I was afraid of failing,” Martínez said. “The only thing motivating me is seeing my family.”\nFarther along toward the Guatemalan capital, in the town of Morales, National Police were checking migrants' documents at a roadblock. Associated Press journalists saw about 20 Honduran migrants being put onto a police vehicle to be driven back to the border because they had not registered with immigration officials there.\nGuatemalan police officers were accompanied at the checkpoint by four agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nSince about May, Homeland Security has deployed dozens of agents and investigators to Guatemala to work as \"advisers\" to the national police there and migration officials. They are also trying to disrupt human smuggling operations.\nThe move was an initial step in the agreement with Guatemala to send asylum-seekers there, and was part of an overall plan by DHS to help strengthen the country's border security in an effort to stem the flow of migrants crossing into the U.S.\nHonduran migrants traveling with a larger group prepare to be deported after being stopped by Guatemalan police in Morales, Guatemala on Jan. 16, 2020. Moises Castillo / AP\nOfficials have not given specifics on how many DHS personnel were on the ground for security reasons. It was an effort brokered by Kevin McAleenan, the former acting head of DHS.\nSimultaneously, the U.S. government was pressuring Mexico to act. In late May, Trump threatened tariffs on all Mexican imports that would have been devastating. Mexico avoided them by agreeing to the expansion of the U.S. program known as “Remain in Mexico” that has led to more than 55,000 asylum seekers waiting out their cases in Mexico and to the deployment of a portion of its newly created National Guard to help stop migrants making their way through the country.\nOn Wednesday, Guatemala's new President Alejandro Giammattei said Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard told him Mexico will not let a migrant caravan pass. Mexico Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez Cordero warned of special operations and immigration agents.\nSome migrants said they were aware that getting to the United States would be tough, but said they would try anyway.\n“We aren't living here, we're just surviving,\" said Elmer Garcia, 26, a migrant from the town of Comayagua who set out from San Pedro Sula. \"So it doesn't make much difference if you die there, or die here.”\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram",

         "It seems almost inane to remark on an electoral horse race at such a historic time. Why should we care about Donald Trump’s electoral chances when energized citizens across America are braving injury and arrest to confront white supremacy and police violence? But it’s important nonetheless.\nThat’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. Rather than help be a part of the solution, he is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril.\nThis isn’t news: he has been for some time. He has consistently trailed all the leading Democratic contenders in national polling since the beginning of the primary campaign—not just nationally, but also in the swing states he needs in the electoral college. If he loses in November he and his defenders will claim he was on a pathway to victory before external forces derailed him, but this would be wrong. Even when the economy was strong, which normally bodes very well for first-term presidents’ odds at winning another four years, much of the persuadable public simply found itself so exhausted by Trump’s ongoing campaign against public decency that they were ready to vote for an alternative who did not take active measures to offend people on a daily basis.\nMatters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus.\nEven before the brutal killing of George Floyd by officers of the Minneapolis Police Department, Trump knew that he would need to maximize his culture war appeal to non-college whites to make up ground lost to the faltering economy. There can be little doubt that Trump saw opportunity in the protests that followed to dust off the Nixon playbook, vowing to restore “law and order” in a country furious that the law seemed to protect only some, while enforcing a brutal order on others. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery.\nThe Trump orbit considers the iconography of jingoistic militarism and the violent suppression of protest to be a political winner. Consider, for instance, Rudy Giuliani’s bizarre 9/11 tribute tweet promoting a video that featured riot police, the military, and high school football squaring off against young protesters replete with counterculture stereotypes, including flag-burners, anti-police sentiment and even men with long hair (how dare they.)\nTrump, like Nixon before him, uses “law and order” as a way of “talking about race without talking about race.” In this narrative, a president who supports American “traditional culture” and stands strong against people who agitate for racial justice will win over a “silent majority” of people who just don’t want to be disturbed and want to have some peace and quiet from their politics.\nIn this context, the killing of George Floyd was not a crisis, but an opportunity.\nA president with an ounce of self-respect, dignity and compassion would have done her best to understand the anguish and grief facing the black community as yet another black person was killed needlessly and with zero remorse by a police force accustomed to no accountability. A president who made a semblance of caring about the country as a whole would have made at least a show of sympathy. Trump could not do even this.\nThis is, first and foremost, because Trump is the same man who published a full-page ad recommending the execution of the innocent Central Park 5, and has refused to apologize for or even retract his position. He is the same man who, as president, implemented a policy of separating immigrant children from their parents to lock them in cages without blankets or toothpaste, as an explicit deterrent to other potential (nonwhite, of course) immigrants seeking a better life. As Adam Serwer unforgettably said, the cruelty is the point.\nTrump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Trump sees shades of a 1968-style law-and-order culture campaign that can carry him to re-election when literally nothing else can.\nAny normal president would have made an Oval Office address to the nation as soon as major protests began. Trump, despite his braggadoccio, showed characteristic cowardice and indecision for days, choosing to post inflammatory tweets while hiding in a White House bunker. When he finally did make a public address, it was little more the chest-puffing false bravado of a petty tyrant.\nHe has encouraged governors to use extreme force against protesters, using “antifa” and a small minority of looters and criminals as an excuse. In a tweet that was flagged with a warning by Twitter for its glorifcation of violence, he used a phrase that harkened back to the segregation era to threaten lethal force against protests. He has repeatedly threatened to use the military to suppress dissent. He has rebuffed the calls of Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia to demilitarize the response to the protests, and has vowed to replace the troops she refuses with forces beyond her control. He has turned the District of Columbia, a plurality black city, into a militarized zone with non-uniformed secret police, and the White House as a closed-off fortress in its center.\nAcross the country, police have intentionally targeted journalists, leaving many with disfiguring injuries. Can there be any doubt that this unprecedented violence against the press was spurred on by Trump’s endless war with any media that holds him accountable? Given that Trump received the support of 84 percent of America’s police officers, how could it be otherwise?\nAnd most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down.\nThe message that Trump wanted to send with this stunt is not hard to decipher. It cast him as the warrior of white evangelical Christianity, waging a holy crusade by force of arms against those who would oppose it as the dominant force in American electoral politics.\nTrump will fail, however, because neither the bastions of white culture nor the nation’s security apparatus are on his side this time. No matter what Trump did previously, the elements that represented these conservative institutional bastions would not condemn him. But Trump’s effort to use the military as both a political and kinetic weapon against Americans exercising their constitutional rights has caused the people who should be his allies to turn against him. It earned him stinging, humiliating rebukes from respected military leaders such as four-star Marine Corps General and former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Conservative columnist George Will has called for the removal of Trump and the Congressional leaders who enable him. This despicable act even earned him condemnation from televangelist Pat Robertson, one his bedrock supporters in the white Christian evangelical movement.\nMeanwhile, people of all races across America have watched in horror as police continue to commit violent acts of brutality against the people who are legally and peacefully protesting police brutality. Statistically speaking, white people have historically not believed that institutional racism in the police force is an issue worth their attention. Now, for the first time, a majority of whites do, and Americans of all races are overwhelmingly supportive of the protests against the killing of George Floyd. If Trump was planning on dividing Americans by race and cleaving more whites to his side, the plan is backfiring. Trump even seems to have a reverse Midas touch in recent polling on these issues: while Americans were broadly supportive of using the military to quell the civil disturbances at first, Trump’s embrace of the tactic seems to have helped drive those numbers into negative territory in just a few days.\nIn one sense, he’s right: people are exhausted with chaos, and they do want a respect for law and order. The problem for Trump? The chaos is in large part of his own making, and insofar as it isn’t, he’s in the way of solving the problems created by institutional racism and overlapping hierarchies of oppression. The massive wave of police brutality has woken even many previously disengaged white people up to the need for true equality under the law, and an order in which everyone, including police and the president, are held to account. And many of the same people Trump is trying to persuade now believe that kicking him out of the White House is a necessary prerequisite for making that vision a reality.",

         "The president must ask that Congress provide incentives to states that tackle fatherlessness. Don’t cut benefits for single mothers, but responsibly raise them for poor married couples.\nIn his State of the Union address this week, besides addressing middle-class capitalism President Trump should announce the launch of a new policy focus called “American Families First.”\nPresident Trump should say he is deeply concerned about hurting American families. America is suffering from an epidemic of fatherlessness, and about a third of our youth are being raised without their biological father.\nA father residing in the home is a huge indicator of a child’s success later in life, even when controlling for ethnicity, location, and education. Children with a biological father in the home are even at a lower risk of child abuse. And marriage is a necessary ingredient to combat fatherlessness due to the inherent instability of cohabitation.\nParents should have the choice to split up, and single mothers should have the choice to be single mothers, but marriage penalties in our welfare programs have started, promoted, and worsened a trend of fatherlessness. A biological dad in the home is directly penalized by most programs, because a biological dad’s income is counted toward welfare eligibility, but a live-in boyfriend’s income is not.\nWhere cohabitating biological parents can hide this fact from authorities and receive welfare as if the mother were on her own, the authorities can instantly look up if a beneficiary is married. So the penalties to marrying can be absolutely staggering. One program alone can penalize marriage by $20,000 per year if a couple has two young children, and programs with marriage penalties now reach up well into the working and middle class.\nSo Let’s Smooth Out These Dropoffs\nThe president must ask that Congress, right now, provide incentives to states that seek to tackle this problem. Don’t cut benefits for single mothers, but responsibly raise them for poor married couples.\nFor example, the program with the biggest marriage penalty in most states is the child-care benefit signed into law by George H.W. Bush. The family income level at which the benefit is cut off could be raised for poor married couples, similar to what is done for those who are married filing jointly in the tax code. And the “benefit cliff,” where more than $10,000 in daycare assistance can immediately disappear if someone earns too much or gets married, can be smoothed out.\nAlthough this and other programs are jointly funded by state and federal governments, this would be a state-level fix (this author has written a detailed proposal to do so, beyond the scope of this article). But the federal government can and should play a role in incentivizing states—through matching state spending on reform with federal dollars—toward reducing marriage penalties in welfare. And the Trump administration’s Department of Health and Human Services should immediately give a clear green light to states that wish to experiment with pro-marriage changes to welfare-eligibility.\nLet People Discharge College Loans in Bankruptcy\nNext, family formation is suffering at least in part due to high student loan debt. President Trump should propose that Congress allow student loan debt to be dischargeable in bankruptcy. Currently it is the only debt you can’t get rid of by declaring bankruptcy. That would both appease over-burdened debtors, and make lenders more careful about lending in the future. And President Trump should ask that Congress increase the tax deduction available for payments of student loan interest and principal.\nFinally, a key element toward building the middle class, which affects our shared prosperity and our ability to sustain our entitlement programs, is a culture of life. All subsidies for abortion, even at the state level, should be done away with. Abortionists, who prey on desperate people, should no longer receive your hard-earned tax dollars.\nPresident Trump should also propose proactive policies to stem abortion. The biggest difference-maker would be to remove marriage penalties, as already mentioned. But the president must also ask Congress to support paid family leave and some form of not-too-generous maternity support. In Eastern Europe, these pro-family policies have led to less abortion, and should be considered here.\nFinally, and thanks to President Trump’s leadership, America has just passed a historic criminal justice reform bill. This will help stop and even reverse the trend of too many young men being thrown in prison for nonviolent drug offenses.\nIn a next step, President Trump should ask that states examine their own criminal justice systems. President Trump should ask that Congress acts to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level so states can decide for themselves on the most appropriate drug policy, so parents and children who are suffering with serious or chronic conditions or illnesses are given all the medically approved tools available for relief.\nImmigration Needs Attention, Too\nWe are a nation where the rule of law is honored. Of course, we should never deport good people for minor traffic offenses. The stories in the media lambasting the agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been incredibly dishonest. Trump needs to point this out.\nFor example, the man picked up by ICE while bringing his pregnant wife to the hospital was actually wanted for a brutal murder in Mexico; and the man whose arrest by ICE sparked a nationally covered protest turned out to be a human-trafficker.\nHonoring the rule of law means deporting foreign citizens who are convicted of rape, murder, domestic violence, or have multiple DUIs. Those are rules Obama’s administration put in place, which the Trump administration has built upon. President Trump needs to absolutely lambast states like California that aren’t reporting even violent criminals to federal immigration authorities. That’s wrong, and it shows how extreme most Democrats have become on illegal immigration.\nWe are also a compassionate nation, and the Bible talks about how children shouldn’t be punished by the government for their parents’ crimes. That’s why the foreign citizens brought here as children—known as “Dreamers”—should be given legal status if they have no serious criminal record. But these “Dreamers” should not be allowed to bring in relatives through chain migration. That would reward law-breaking.\nCare for Refugee Children\nFinally, our compassion requires us to actually care about refugee children, and see past the surface of misleading and dishonest headlines. The policy put in place to deal with migrant children before the president took office actually hurt these children.\nHere’s why: Many adults caught crossing the border illegally claim asylum. The United States considers these claims seriously, and it takes many months to process and investigate an adult’s asylum claim.\nAs bad people figured out that children could be used to get into America, bad people started bringing more children from Central America.\nBut current law places a 20-day limit on holding children. In order to not separate an adult who claims asylum from the children the adult crossed the border with, the previous administration let the adult into America well before authorities had finished checking out the asylum claim. These adults are supposed to show up in court, but many do not. Meanwhile, adults who didn’t bring children are stuck waiting on the border, and if their asylum claim is rejected, they are immediately deported.\nAs bad people figured out that children could be used to get into America, bad people started bringing more children from Central America. In other words, some people are using children as get-into-America-free tickets. That’s terrible.\nAmnesty International has reported that well more than half of women and girls coming from Central America are sexually assaulted on this dangerous trip (overall, about a third crossing the border illegally are sexually assaulted), and evidence abounds of human trafficking. No matter what, we should want as few women and girls making the trip as possible.\nThe president should say that he will work tirelessly to make sure that there is no bad incentive to bring children on a terrible and dangerous trip, and that he will work to crack down on human trafficking at the border. He needs to hammer the Democrats, and not be defensive (which we shouldn’t be too worried about, because he’s Trump). The president should look at the Democrats and clearly say that the policies they are pushing encourage bad people to use children as tickets into America. They should be lambasted eternally for that.\nFinally, most of the time in America—at least compared to the rest of the world—common sense prevails. Cracking down on human trafficking, drugs, and crime absolutely requires building a wall at the southern border. There is no border security without a wall. Trump should once-again say that he will continue to look out for American workers, and the safety of American families and children, as his highest priority.\nPut American Families First on Foreign Policy\nWe beat ISIS, and the territory it formerly held has been liberated. Some say it isn’t gone, and has gone underground.\nBut by these metrics we will never leave Syria, and that is unacceptable to the American people. ISIS functions from a radical Sunni Muslim ideology that is all too prominent in the Middle East. You can’t fight an ideology that is widely held by the people you are trying to liberate.\nYou can’t fight an ideology that is widely held by the people you are trying to liberate.\nIt is now up to moderate Muslims and the local power-brokers in Syria—including our allies Saudi Arabia and Turkey, who have funded radical jihadists—to combat that radical ideology. American should no longer spend our blood and treasure to do the job for them. So Trump should again stress that he will pull us out of Syria.\nPresident Trump also needs to commit to fully removing our forces from Afghanistan. We have been there for 17 years and spent trillions of dollars, and the situation on the ground is little changed. The president should say that he cannot in good conscience continue to ask that our service-members make the ultimate sacrifice when there appears to be no good military solution. We must stop listening to the same voices that have been wrong about so much for decades, and got us into the disaster that was the Iraq War.\nOverall, President Trump should say that we will be withdrawing from combat zones where there is no clear, achievable objective. We must ask ourselves: Is intervening in a particular conflict in America’s core interests? Is there an achievable objective, and an exit strategy? How long will it take before we can leave?\nIs the fight of such importance that they would be willing to send their own children into it, possibly to die?\nAll policymakers and prognosticators must ask themselves: Is the fight of such importance that they would be willing to send their own children into it, possibly to die? We must ask ourselves: Is it worth the cost that will inevitably be paid by brave American men and women—our sons and daughters?\nAmerica has the strongest fighting force in human history, but our might must be conserved and used wisely. America has spent several trillion dollars on the “War on Terror” in Afghanistan and Iraq, and maybe even $6 trillion. That money would be better spent here at home, paying down our debt or investing in the American people.\nThe engine of America is its families. And Middle Class Capitalism doesn’t work with weak American families. Too often, politicians have tinkered with the tax code instead of being worried about the health of the American family, which affects our shared prosperity and our happiness.\nAmerican Families First means ditching welfare’s marriage penalties, it means life is protected, it means valuing Americans over foreign workers, and it means being careful where we send our sons and daughters who are serving in our military.",

In speaking with Velshi & Ruhle, Nye spoke about how climate change is more gradual than disasters such as Pearl Harbor or 9/11, but the effects are still as serious, if not more.\nThe Trump administration has continued to deny climate change findings and make scientific reports inaccessible to the public.

         "When Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech nearly 56 years ago, it came against a backdrop of significant societal tumult, including the assassination of Medgar Evers just two months earlier. The civil rights leader’s remarks spoke to the sense of urgency.\n“This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism,” MLK said in his remarks. “Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.”\nVice President Mike Pence apparently felt justified appropriating King’s rhetoric into the White House’s immigration agenda, arguing on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” yesterday:\n“You know, the hearts and minds of the American people today are thinking a lot about it being the weekend where we remember the life and work of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. One of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was, ‘Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.’ “You think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. That’s exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do. Come to the table in a spirit of good faith.”\nOf course, the last time congressional Democratic leaders went to the negotiating table “in a spirit of good faith,” Donald Trump walked away from the table after being told he couldn’t have what he thinks he’s entitled to.\nBut even putting aside the relevant details, Pence’s use of King’s quote is hopelessly misguided. For one thing, given everything we know about King’s record, it’s simply implausible to think the iconic leader would have endorsed a far-right campaign intended to demonize and punish immigrants. Indeed, the NAACP called Pence’s comments “an insult” to King’s legacy.\nFor another, if we’re going to make real the promises of democracy, we’re going to have to reject Team Trump’s misguided wall crusade.\nTrump ran on a platform of building a wall with Mexican money, and on Election Day 2016, more Americans voted for his opponent. The Republican president proceeded to pitch an aggressively anti-immigrant message ahead of Election Day 2018, when voters handed Democrats control of the House.\nIn the months that followed, all independent polling has found the American mainstream not only blames Trump and his party for the shutdown, but also does not want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective and unnecessary border wall.\nIt’s against this backdrop that the president wants to short circuit the American policymaking process – which is supposed to involve introducing an idea, sending it to committee, allowing for congressional debate and amendments, holding a series of legislative votes, etc. – and instead have his demands met through an extortion strategy built around holding the government hostage.\nIf Mike Pence thinks Trump’s demands for a border wall have anything to do with “the promises of democracy,” he’s looking at reality through a rather twisted lens. To take democracy seriously is to do the opposite of what the president commands.",

         "Trash talking is a proven, time honored way of hyping fans and piquing interest before a big fight. However, sometimes trash talking can get taken way too far.\nUFC Middleweight Champion Israel Adesanya a native of New Zealand, was speaking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday before his title defense against Yoel Romero at UFC 248 in Auckland, New Zealand. While trying to explain why he has no fear of Romero, Adesanya made a reference to the “Twin Towers.”\n“He’s a guy no one wants to fight,” Adesanya explained.\n“Boogeyman, everyone keeps saying, oh – even Darren Till – ‘I’ll fight anyone except Yoel.’ Like, why? I’ve seen him get rocked. I’ve seen him get stopped. I’ve seen him get bloodied. I’ve seen him cry. I’ll make him cry.\n“He’s human like anyone else, and everyone likes to make this myth about, ‘Oh, he’s steel, like kicking steel,’ or you hit him and he doesn’t fall. I’ll touch him enough times.

         "Why do progressive news sites that expose government and corporate disinformation in other areas accept disinformation when it comes to vaccines–actually calling activists “unscientific”?\nIt is not surprising mainstream scientists are vaccine absolutists who vilify “anti-vaxxers” given that their medical centers, hospital wings, universities and sometimes personal paychecks are funded by Pharma. (The motive of progressive sites is less clear.) But “Pharma knows best” rings false with a quick look at withdrawn drugs like Vioxx, Bextra, Baycol, Trovan, Meridia, Darvon, Phen-Fen, Raxar and Seldane–all called safe when they were making millions.\nNeither mainstream nor progressive news sites want to acknowledge the existence of the federal National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) which, since 1988, has settled more than 16,000 claims and awarded $3.18 billion in injury settlements. When I asked a vaccine expert why the court existed if vaccines are unremittingly safe he told me that vaccines are so basic to public health yet so non-lucrative (compared to billion dollar pills), the government does not want vaccine makers bankrupted by lawsuits.\nBut ignoring the court and the ghastly injuries it settles—I was told, off the record, about a woman who lost her fingers and toes from vasculitis caused by a vaccine—mainstream scientists are the ones who are “unscientific.” The truth is not all vaccines are safe, life-saving or necessary and conflicts of interest do exist. Consider the case of Gardasil, a vaccine against the human papillomavirus vaccine types 6, 11, 16, 18.\nThe Case of Gardasil\nA few years ago, Merck aggressively marketed Gardasil, a vaccine against the HPV virus (which is linked to venereal warts and cervical cancer)–even in poor countries where cervical cancer is hardly a leading cause of death compared to malaria or diarrheal diseases. (In developed countries, a Pap test is as effective as a vaccine in preventing cervical cancer.)\nLast year, judges in India’s Supreme Court demanded answers after children died during a trial of Gardasil and Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline’s counterpart vaccine, a few years earlier.\nAccording to CBS News there was another cloud over Gardasil. “Merck gave $6,000 to [Texas Gov. Rick] Perry’s election campaign fund as part of a national lobbying effort to persuade states that it ought to require Gardasil as one of the vaccines all kids should have before attending school,” it wrote. The director of a Merck-funded pro-Gardasil group was also Perry’s then-chief of staff’s mother-in-law.\nNor did the departure of former CDC director Julie Gerberding to head Merck’s vaccines division look right to many ethics specialists.\nDocs Gone Bad\nMainstream scientists have savaged Andrew Wakefield, a British medical researcher found to have conducted fraudulent research linking the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. His corruption is said to disprove any scientific doubts about vaccine safety.\nYet when researchers in the U.S. have been so corrupt they have gone to jail, mainstream scientists still accept their research. Scott Reuben published fraudulent research on Lyrica, Effexor, Celebrex and other drugs for Pharma. He went to prison for six months but the “science” behind the drugs he promoted stands. Richard Borison, former psychiatry chief at Augusta Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center and Medical College of Georgia, went to prison for 15 years for using clinical trials on veterans of the antipsychotic Seroquel to line his own pockets. The drug went on to earn billions and his for-profit “research” still stands.\nAs a reporter I have interviewed a man whose blindness was caused by a 1976 flu vaccine for which the government compensated him. More recently I interviewed a parent whose normal toddler was never the same after a vaccine and is now institutionalized. “He cried hysterically for 24 hours,” the parent, who is a medical practitioner, told me.\nPharma is unwise to cast such parents, of whom there are many, as “nuts.” The degeneration of their child is not their imagination. Also, there is no defensible reason for vaccines to be given all at once to a child, which many say heightens risks. Administering clusters of vaccines–once not given to children–has been called a major, new profit center for pediatricians.\nBut anti-vaccination activists should also not be absolutist. Would anyone refuse a rabies vaccine after being bitten by a rabid raccoon? A tetanus shot after a serious wound? Would responsible parents deny their child a whooping cough or polio vaccine?\nLike all drugs aggressively marketed these days, patients and parents need to do their own research and weigh benefits and risks—never forgetting Pharma’s spotty safety record.",

         "Welcome to the election of the mask, choose your side wisely.\nNow that most of America has begun opening back up without the predicted spikes in coronavirus and Joe Biden has left his basement bunker, Americans are remembering that there’s an election going on. As normalcy quickly returns some places, so to has the battle for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\nThe Chinese virus has left a symbolic mark on the race. The facemask has emerged not just as an issue on the trail, but also as a signal as to one’s likely political leanings.\nDonald Trump has taken heat for mostly refusing to mask up while performing his duties. This left the Biden camp with a choice to make when Joe woke up from political hibernation, and they went all in. Now it’s Joe getting into a car in a mask, Joe at a monument in a mask, Joe being interviewed in a mask, and in many cases he is socially distancing while wearing it, which the CDC does not advise.\nNew York Gov. Cuomo chimed in on the ubiquitous chinstraps saying that they have become, “Almost a point of cultural communication. Wearing a mask now is cool.” He joked about signing an executive order making masks cool.\nHe’s been making a lot of jokes recently as the Empire State crumbles, but this one had a germ of truth in it. The mask, especially in socially distanced situations is not about science anymore, it’s about signaling that the virus is too dangerous for our lives to return to normal. It sends the message that the pliant wearer will do as they are told and entitles them to heap scorn on those who won’t. Not surprisingly this often breaks down on party lines.\nTo be clear, almost nobody, including the president thinks that masks have no role to play as we reopen the economy. It makes sense to wear one in close space where you can’t be six feet apart, here in Brooklyn, an epicenter of the virus most people, myself included usually do that. But when walking down the street, or sitting on a park bench there is little reason to believe masks have much efficacy.\nFor our friends on the Left, Trump’s refusal to wear a mask is irresponsible toxic masculinity that is sending the wrong message and getting people killed, even though Dr. Deborah Brix has explained it’s not much of a risk. Biden, meanwhile, to their minds is leading by example by wearing his mask even when there is no good reason he should.\nWhen you set aside the names of the politicians and parties, the divide that is revealed has most to do with how much control people want the government to have over their lives. Progressives are clear that their answer is a whole lot. From the Green New Deal to “Medicare for All,” banning guns, and now even to surveillance in the case of things like contact tracing, they invite a state that leaves individuals with far less choice and freedom.\nOne way to describe societies that decide to scrub away individual liberty is faceless; people are identical cogs without unique features. Here we move from the symbolic to the literal as people hide their faces from the world. The most important thing about these people is now that piece of fabric and the compliance it indicates. There will be no smiling.\nJoe Biden and the Democrats are the party of the mask, the party of government power and intervention. For them the Chinese virus is an opportunity to seize, as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio put it, to create a new New Deal. Ultimately this election may now come down to a fight between Americans who want to return almost fully to life as it was, and those who seek a less free “new normal.”\nThis point might be made as forcefully as the Democrats doing a Zoom convention where Nancy Pelosi gives a speech in front of her fancy fridge and a GOP that trips the light fantastic in a rock’em, sock’em in-person live rally event. Should that occur, the contrast could not help but frame the contest. This is the election of the mask, and its just about time to choose your side.",

         "If Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has her way, USA Powerlifting will soon find themselves under investigation for discrimination for preventing biological males from competing in women’s events.\nThe newly-minted representative from Minnesota copied Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on a letter she sent to USA Powerlifting. In which, she requested that Ellison investigate the powerlifting governing body for discrimination. Specifically, discrimination against biological males, by not allowing them to compete in women’s events. Omar believes USA Powerlifting is discriminating against males who identify as transgender women, based on the “myth” that they have a “direct competitive advantage” over biological females.\nOmar’s letter was prompted by the story of JayCee Cooper, a male weightlifter who identifies as a woman. Cooper also resides in Omar’s district.\nOmar wrote:\nI am writing to express my concern over a recent decision by USA powerlifting to bar participation by my constituent, Ms. JayCee Cooper, because she is transgender. Under the Minnesota Human Rights Act, discrimination against anyone based on their gender identity is illegal. This includes in public accommodations, and in Minnesota, organizations such as USA Powerlifting. In fact, just last month a Minnesota jury awarded Ms. Christina Ginther $20,000 after the Independent Women’s Football League refused to allow her to participate because she is transgender. I urge you to reconsider this discriminatory, unscientific policy and follow the example of the International Olympic Committee. The myth that trans women have a “direct competitive advantage” is not supported by medical science, and it continues to stoke fear and violence against one of the most at-risk communities in the world. While I do not have direct jurisdiction over this matter as a U.S. congresswoman, I’m sending this letter to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison with a recommendation that he investigate this discriminatory behavior.\nIn January, USA Powerlifting issued a rule banning biological males from competing in women’s events. Conversely, biological females are allowed to compete in men’s events. However, the women are required to follow the same protocols regarding testosterone, and other performance enhancers.\nThe weightlifting governing body explained their reasoning on their website.\n“Men naturally have a larger bone structure, higher bone density, stronger connective tissue and higher muscle density than women. These traits, even with reduced levels of testosterone do not go away. While [male-to-female athletes] may be weaker and less muscle than they once were, the biological benefits given them at birth still remain over that of a female.”\nIn her letter, Omar makes specific reference to International Olympic Committee guidelines, when deciding how to incorporate transgender athletes. However, as USA Powerlifting points out, IOC guidelines give various sports some latitude when it comes to implementing policy regarding transgender participation.\n“…the IOC Guidelines also allows sports to determine the impact on fair play through such inclusion. The IPF Medical Committee, while respecting the rights of those who choose to transition, has been consistent in its opinion that use of testosterone and participation of male to female transgender athletes in our sport compromises fair play.”\nEllison has not yet said whether he will investigate USA Powerlifting.\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn",

         "Promoting public health through vaccines seems like the right thing to do, but there's a good reason to preserve religious exemptions: Some vaccines rely on cell lines from aborted fetal tissue.\nIn recent years, religious exemptions from vaccination mandates have been eliminated in some states. It began in 2015 in California, followed by Maine, New York, and Washington. Although protecting ourselves and others with vaccinations seems like the reasonable and Christian thing to do, there remains a significant reason to retain religious or conscience exemptions: Several vaccinations use cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue.\nTo produce vaccine antigens, viruses are propagated in host cells of other types. To maintain a ready and manageable supply of host cells, cell lines — a subculture of cells isolated from organic tissues — are maintained in laboratories. Two cell lines, named WI-38 and MRC-5, derived from the tissue of aborted fetuses, serve the manufacturing of some vaccines used in the United States.\nThe existence of WI-38 and MRC-5 is not new and has been defended extensively by three main arguments. First, the fetuses were not aborted for the purpose of making the vaccines. Second, these existing cell lines do not require ongoing abortions. Third, the overall benefit to public health is a worthy reason to continue manufacturing these vaccines. Let us consider these arguments in turn.\nThe Purpose of the Abortion\nWhile mothers may not have had vaccines in mind when choosing abortion, abortionists and researchers had established relationships for this purpose. Researcher Leonard Hayflick sought out aborted human fetal tissue because he reasoned it would be less likely than other tissues to be contaminated by viruses. He also showed that fetal cell lines have the advantages of numerous subcultivations and susceptibility to viruses, making them ideal for mass producing vaccines.\nNineteen fetuses were used to develop cell lines WI-1 through WI-25, and after they were lost when Hayflick’s lab freezer failed, he acquired more aborted-baby tissue from a colleague in Sweden. Using this tissue, Hayflick developed more cell lines, with line WI-38 continuing to be used today for vaccine production. Strain MRC-5 was developed from an aborted baby for the purpose of vaccine development.\nWhile parents are not seeking abortions to populate cell lines for vaccine manufacturing, researchers and abortionists recognize the benefit of fetal tissue for vaccine development, and have established relationships to facilitate the supply of this tissue to researchers. Research might be an indirect purpose of abortion, but it is still the intent of some parties involved.\nMost lay people today reason, “Of course I’m not participating in the abortions. I wasn’t there. I didn’t encourage the mothers to abort. I wasn’t looking for tissue to develop a vaccine.” If one is not complicit in the abortion, what’s the harm in trying to bring some good out of it?\nTo make a cell line, the parts of the aborted body are minced, treated with an enzyme solution, and centrifuged into individual living cells to be cultured in a nourishing serum. These cells are subcultured and multiplied. Current cell lines WI-38 and MRC-5 are living cells, derived from the fetus, carrying the same DNA as the body from which they came.\nUnlike the abortion itself, which could be distanced from our experience as a singular event in history, the ongoing use of the aborted body continues today, serving the demand for some vaccines.\nNo More Abortion?\nAlthough advocates of these vaccines argue no more abortions are needed, new cell lines derived from aborted fetal tissue continue to be developed. Researchers are concerned that cell reproduction in these strains will eventually become nonviable, or at least more difficult to access.\nThey are also motivated to discover increased duplication rates, higher limits to duplication, and improved suitability for viral propagation. Researchers have developed cell lines — including IMR-90, IMR-91, PER.C6, and Walvax-2 — from aborted fetuses, with the intent of supplementing or replacing WI-38 and MRC-5 for vaccine development.\nDemand for these vaccines gives implicit abortion approval for fetal tissue research. Promoting products of abortion encourages the partnership between abortion providers and medical researchers, as well as the social acceptance of this partnership. For example, President Bill Clinton justified federal funding for fetal tissue research by the success of these vaccines. While President George W. Bush said, “We do not end some lives for the medical benefit of others,” he allowed “federal funding for research on existing stem cell lines.”\nFollowing the 2015 criticisms against Planned Parenthood for providing fetal tissue for research, researchers responded that such experimentation is necessary, has great benefits, and should continue, pointing specifically to the precedent of vaccine development. While the Trump administration recently ended government funding for most fetal tissue research, the policy change does nothing to alter the legality of fetal tissue research. Recent efforts to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 have again raised the question of the ethics of using fetal cell lines.\nPublic Health Benefit\nWhat of the ill effects of the diseases these vaccines are given to prevent? Rubella, in particular, can be devastating to the unborn. Would we fail to love our neighbor if we had an effective vaccine yet did not use it?\nEven pro-life leaders have expressed their approval of using vaccines produced with fetal cell lines, in cases with no alternative. The Vatican allowed the use of those vaccines for a “proportionate reason:” The overall defense of life expressed by vaccination against rubella was more significant than a boycott of these vaccines, especially if users expressed their objections and recognized the use was under a kind of duress.\nProponents of these vaccines twist the Vatican’s words to sound like approval: The use of such vaccines “was certainly justifiable,” does not “defy the religion’s doctrine,” raises “no theological objection,” and is “morally acceptable.” Yet a careful read of the Vatican’s essay in no way gives this impression.\nThe Vatican maintained that the preparation, marketing, and use of such vaccines is illicit, and their use can be allowed only because it occurs under coercion. It named the current situation “an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible.” Using the vaccines can be justified only if it does more to defend, uphold, and promote life by preventing disease than the refusal to use these vaccines.\nThe Vatican gave this advice in 2005, with the expectation that Christians’ objections would eventually lead to alternative vaccines. Unfortunately, the guidance did little to disrupt the widespread acceptance of vaccines using fetal cell lines. Rather, in 2009, Merck discontinued the separate measles and mumps vaccines, and offered them only as a combination with the rubella vaccine as MMR or MMRV, both of which use fetal cell lines.\nYet developing and manufacturing vaccines that do not use fetal cell lines is quite possible. Japanese manufacturers have produced both rubella and hepatitis A vaccines using nonhuman cell sources. However, they are not licensed for use in the United States.\nReligious Exemptions as Part of a Unified Public Voice\nWithout clear, firm Christian voices objecting to these vaccines, and without demand for alternatives, it is unlikely any replacements will be developed or made available in the United States. Many Christians are simply unaware of this connection between some vaccines and abortion. We need active and regular publicity of this connection to raise awareness.\nThe Christian public voice should be clear and consistent. With legislative trends going against religious exemptions, strong statements from religious leaders and institutions become increasingly important. Although federal case law recognizes religious liberty to some extent, official church statements will strengthen individual claims.\nEven if official statements don’t say whether we should or shouldn’t get a vaccine, they should uphold the conscience rights to object to vaccine use. Without such institutional support for conscientious decisions, individuals have difficulty arguing for religious exemption.\nChristians should also ask providers for alternative vaccines, or, where alternatives do not exist, that they be developed. Such requests can be made of providers, but should especially be communicated formally to vaccine manufacturers and distributors. In some cases, Christians may choose to refuse vaccinations manufactured with cell strains developed from abortions.\nIn these ways, Christian laity and pastors can embrace a firm stance that the world cannot confuse as acceptance of the status quo. Christians should make clear that the perpetuation of objectionable vaccines and the lack of alternatives is a kind of coercion. A strong Christian voice can restore a situation in which churches have nothing to do with abortion, no longer accepting health benefits at the cost of others’ lives.",

         "One need not be an expert in negotiations to understand the basic elements of a deal. At its core, one side tells another, “I’ll give you x, if you give me y.” If the parties agree to the terms, an agreement is reached, and the transaction goes forward.\nIn the dominant political fight in D.C., Donald Trump wants a giant wall along the U.S./Mexico border. In order to reach his goal, the Republican president is prepared to offer congressional Democrats … nothing. The purported author of the ghost-written “Art of the Deal” – a man who routinely pretends to be a world-class authority on negotiations – is trying to reach an agreement in which his White House makes no concessions.\nTrump simply wants Democratic lawmakers to give him more than $5 billion for a vanity project – as if he’s entitled to it. The wall should be a reward for how awesome the president’s awesomeness is. For some reason, this hasn’t worked.\nOf course, Trump could try a more conventional approach to negotiating, in which he offered something tangible that Democrats want in exchange for what he wants. In fact, some on the right are concerned the president may eventually do exactly that. The New York Times published a quote the other day that stood out for me:\n“I’ve always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall – I think that’s still a potential danger,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that argues for less immigration. “I’m still worried about that now.”\nFrom a conservative perspective, those concerns are well grounded. Democrats really don’t want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a giant, ineffective border wall, so if Trump were try to come up with an offer designed to entice them, he’d have to propose something that would be (a) enormous; and (b) wildly unpopular among Republicans.\nAnd this got me thinking: what exactly would it take? What would a borderline-desperate president put on the table to sway Democrats?\nAs of yesterday, the White House’s position was plainly absurd: if Democrats agreed to finance a border wall, Trump would end the shutdown. Since the government has to re-open anyway, and that’s a priority for both parties, it obviously can’t be the basis for a credible deal.\nSimilarly, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) suggested the president offer a debt-ceiling increase and higher domestic spending caps. Of course, raising the debt limit falls into the same category as re-opening government – it’s a bipartisan priority that has to happen – though higher domestic spending caps is at least a step in the right direction.\nI’ve seen some talk about offering DACA protections to Dreamers in exchange for a wall, but Trump has already rejected this offer in the recent past, and besides, at least for now, those DACA protections already exist.\nIt’s why Republicans will have to think much bigger. What if Trump offered some combination of a universal background check system on gun purchases, dramatically expanded voting rights, and new health care protections? Would Dems be tempted to write a check for the border?\nI don’t know. Maybe the president should try it and see what happens.",

         "Many of the U.S. Border Patrol agents on the front lines of the U.S. effort to secure the southern border with Mexico bristle at what they see as public misconceptions and media mischaracterization of their work.\nIn Fox Nation's new series \"Lara Logan Has No Agenda,\" veteran correspondent Lara Logan traveled to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where she interviewed a horse patrol unit of the U.S. Border Patrol. These men were all born and raised in the area and most of them are Hispanics.\n\"At the end of a long day, with the light fading fast, they rested their horses and waited into the night for the next call,\" narrated Logan. \"It seemed like a good moment for a conversation, a glimpse of the view from their side.\n\"What's one of the things that just drives you crazy that people believe about what's going on down here that's just not true?\" she asked.\nJose Calderon, a U.S. Border Patrol agent, replied: \"I think a lot of it is how they portray us as like villains. How bad of a job we do or that we're mean to people. That's not the case. We all have families.\"\nLogan pressed: \"So why do it then? What does it mean to you? What do you see as your mission?\"\nCalderon said: \"Pretty much we're here to protect our borders, protect our country, that's what we stand for, I think. That's what I stand for.\"\nEarlier in the episode, Logan was joined by Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, as she got a rare look inside an immigration processing center in McAllen, Texas, which is the largest in the country.\nIn July 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats visited a similar processing center in Clint, Texas, and made explosive allegations about the conditions there.\nAt the time, illegal border crossings were surging and overwhelming facilities built to temporarily detain people. According to federal government data released in 2019, Border Patrol agents apprehended more migrants at the border in fiscal year 2019 than in any year since fiscal 2007.\n'UNBEARABLE' INTERVIEW OF WOMEN FORCED INTO SEX TRADE: LARA LOGAN\n\"At first, Democrats accused President Trump of manufacturing a crisis at the border,\" reported Logan. \"Then with Border Patrol overwhelmed, checkpoints shut down and the number of people crossing at record levels, Democrats switched from manufactured crisis to humanitarian, and turned their sights on processing centers that were overflowing.\"\nOcasio-Cortez told reporters after her July tour: \"In that last facility, I was not safe from the officers in that facility.\"\nThe congresswoman said she found it to be a \"violent culture.\" In a video released on Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez accused the U.S. government of running \"concentration camps\" on the border.\n\"We were arresting 12,000 people per week here,\" said Rodolfo Karisch, who is Chief Patrol Agent in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. \"At one point time, I had 9,000 people in custody at all of our facilities, including the one that you're in.\"\nLOGAN CONFRONTS ALLEGED CARTEL DOCTOR, ACCUSED OF TORTURING DEA AGENT\nDeputy Patrol Agent in Charge Oscar Escamilla told Logan: \"I have gang members coming in here. As a matter of fact, I have two subjects who committed murder in the last 24 hours that we apprehended -- in this place. One of them committed double murders in the U.S. that we have in our custody.\"\nKarisch said: \"There is endless possibilities of what could happen. But it always comes back to this. People need to understand exactly what our job is. Our job is to protect this country, our communities. We're part of these communities. We care about what happens here.\"\nIn fact, one of the Border Patrol's biggest concerns in determining which children in their facilities are being smuggled or trafficked by the Mexican cartels.\n\"An agent said to me once, 'When I'm sitting in this center and I've got a father and a child in front of me... I'm looking at that child knowing that if this isn't his father, I'm his last hope'\" said Logan.\n\"That's correct,\" agreed Escamilla. \"This child could be exploited further.\"\nBack in the field with the horse patrol agent, Logan asked them how they felt about the way the media represents them.\n\"I think the inaccuracy comes from the incompleteness,\" said agent Jorge Deleon. \"They only put out portions and sections of what we do. And there's never been a full [telling] to where it's a full understanding and educational for people to understand what it is that we do.\"\nEXCLUSIVE: LARA LOGAN CORNERED BY MEXICAN POLICE, THREATENED\nCalderon added: \"You speak to these [migrants] and they'll tell you the more dangerous part of the journey is crossing Mexico. And then, they end up in the best hands. I mean, we provide them with food. We clothe them, even give them medical attention. We bathe them. I mean, we give them everything, basically, what they need.\n\"And then the media comes\" he continued. \"They say they're putting them in cages when that's not the case.\"\nLogan said: \"I almost feel like you have to apologize for upholding the law and protecting the border.\"\nCalderon agreed.\n\"They make it feel like it's wrong -- to actually do what your job is -- what you're supposed to be doing,\" said Calderon.\nThis episode is one installment of the four-part docuseries \"Lara Logan Has No Agenda,\" which is focused on immigration, socialism, media bias and veterans. \"Lara Logan Has No Agenda\" is available exclusively on Fox Nation.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but only for Fox Nation subscribers.

         "Six Republican Senators have failed to develop a coalition for their plan that exchanges a fifth of border wall funding for an amnesty for illegal aliens and increased immigration.\nThe plan, described to Breitbart News, was a creation of Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Susan Collins (R-ME), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and would have tied $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump’s proposed border wall to an amnesty for illegal aliens enrolled and eligible in President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\nAlso included in the plan was a provision to provide amnesty to foreign nationals who are in the United States as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries. The amnesty would have been rewarded to anywhere between 1.2 and 3.5 million DACA-enrolled and DACA-eligible illegal aliens, as well as the roughly 325,000 TPS foreign nationals.\nThe GOP Senators’ plan would have additionally increased the number of non-agricultural foreign workers that U.S. companies can import to take blue-collar American jobs. Already, the H-2B program gives business 66,000 cheap foreign workers every year.\nIn statements to the media, Graham said the plan had failed to come to fruition and garner support:\nSen GRAHAM says efforts to find a compromise path to reopen the government aren’t working: “I see no path forward…” — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) January 10, 2019\nGRAHAM: “I’m done.” Q: So you’re saying there are no more conversations happening on finding a compromise?

This is possibly nine million additional foreign nationals who would be admitted to the country, in addition to the 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants that arrive annually.\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Today, New Jersey is stepping up to replace federal Title X funding for family planning providers to ensure that New Jersey’s women and families have access to high-quality reproductive health care resources and family planning services.\nMarie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life, said the bill was a “disgraceful” money grab that ultimately helps an organization that supports Democrats during elections:\nShame on Murphy and Dem legislature forcing NJ taxpayers to fund PP abortion biz #abortionhurtswomen #womendeservebetterthanpp#standagainstplannedparenth\ntood #njprolife #prolife https://t.co/2OPhWpe0Dx — NJ Right to Life (@NJRTL) January 2, 2020\n“The taxpayers of New Jersey should not be forced to fund abortion – and make no mistake – that is what this bill will do,” Tasy said.\nIn August, Planned Parenthood made the decision to opt out of the federal family planning grant program, portraying itself as a victim of the Trump administration.\nThe Trump administration’s Protect Life Rule required Planned Parenthood and other providers to end referring women and girls for abortions if the organizations still wanted to receive some $60 million in federal Title X family planning funds. The Trump administration has made it clear that abortion is neither health care nor family planning.\nSubsequently, Planned Parenthood asked a federal appeals court to block the rule so that it could continue to receive federal funds as it still refers women for abortion – its primary moneymaking enterprise.\nThe group said it “will be forced out” of Title X unless the court blocks the Protect Life Rule – which it refers to as a “gag rule”:\nWe just told the Ninth Circuit: unless the court steps in, @PPFA health centers will be forced out of the Title X program due to the Trump admin’s gag rule — putting access to birth control and other essential care at risk for millions who get care through Title X. #ProtectX pic.twitter.com/x0E858hwbY — Planned Parenthood (@PPFA) August 14, 2019\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, nevertheless, rejected Planned Parenthood’s request.\n“Trump’s administration is trying to force us to keep information from our patients,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, acting Planned Parenthood president. “The gag rule is unethical, dangerous, and we will not subject our patients to it. We are considering all of our options.”\nPrior to the court’s decision to allow the rule to continue, however, Planned Parenthood indicated nationally that it would rather withdraw from the Title X program and use other funding available so that it might continue to refer for abortions.\nThe new rule prohibits the use of the funds to “perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning.”\nPlanned Parenthood’s annual reports show it performs about 330,000 abortions each year, as many of its other services have been in decline.\nIn a report released in 2017, the Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI), the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, confirmed Planned Parenthood obtains 35 percent of the U.S. abortion market – a figure that well overtakes the market shares of leaders in other industries.\n“The level of market dominance for abortions demonstrated by Planned Parenthood could be taught in business schools as the ultimate example of strategic planning and execution,” wrote CLI President Chuck Donovan and Vice President Dr. James Studnicki. “It is a defining activity.”\nThe report also observed that Planned Parenthood provided less than 1.4 percent of the nation’s HIV tests and less than 1 percent of pap tests. Additionally, in the previous five years, service-to-client ratios for breast exams and pap tests had declined by 37 percent.\nMia Heck, spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) responded to Planned Parenthood’s objections to the Protect Life Rule with the statement:\nTo the extent that Planned Parenthood claims that it must make burdensome changes to comply with the Final Rule, it is actually choosing to place a higher priority on the ability to refer for abortion instead of continuing to receive federal funds to provide a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services to clients in need of these services.\nIn addition, Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, said in a statement it was “no surprise” that Planned Parenthood would withdraw from Title X.\nPlanned Parenthood knows its decision to withdraw “will feed its reality distortion field that, despite being one of the most generously tax-funded nonprofits in America, it is somehow being attacked simply because the Department of Health and Human Services wishes to respect congressional intent,” Foster said.\n“And Congress was clear: Title X was never meant to fund abortions,” she continued. “The law is clear.”\nPlanned Parenthood still receives over $500 million in taxpayer funds each year.",

         "Several years ago, I began to recognize treadmills. Not the ones at the gym—I’m talking about lifestyle treadmills: the paths we take in life based upon well-established social and institutional norms. These are the paths we rarely question because, well, “everyone does it.”\nWe stepped off the public education treadmill in 2011, when we began homeschooling. We exited the convenience treadmill a few years later when we moved from an established neighborhood to a farm in a small town 25 miles away. And that move got us off our next treadmill.\nOnce we lived miles from our regular physicians and weren’t required to be “current” on vaccinations, we simply didn’t make doctors’ appointments. Other than a rotten appendix, none of us have been sick enough in the five years since our move to warrant a visit, but I digress.\nHealth Care Has Become a Treadmill\nI was born in 1962, just seven years after Jonas Salk’s discovery became available for public use—a time which could be referred to as the “decade of vaccines.”\nMy parents told stories of swimming pool hysteria, iron lungs, and classmates who suffered the effects of polio. Measles was killing children polio wasn’t, rubella was causing miscarriages and birth defects, and the mumps vaccine had just been improved. My sister and I were vaccinated for them all individually before the combined MMR vaccine came to market in the 1970s, and my parents were very grateful for that opportunity.\nThe peace of mind brought by vaccine science and antibiotics elevated the practice of medicine. If you got sick, you went to the doctor. You received some kind of pill you took until you felt better, no matter how many were left in the bottle (see antibiotic resistance).\nHomeopathic remedies began to look like more like witchcraft, compared with the success and ease of modern medicine. It was easier to take prescription medications than to ride out their inconveniences or research other methods of treatment.\nBut today, the pendulum is swinging back. With Obamacare and the associated gargantuan rise in health care costs, many citizens are being forced to pay attention to their personal health, contributing to a rise in alternative medicine. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, nearly 40 percent of the US adult population used some kind of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in 2008, including diet-based therapies, massage or acupuncture, and/or natural products and supplements such as herbs and essential oils.\nIs it unbelievable then, that parents would begin to question the safety, efficacy and necessity of their child’s vaccinations as well?\nWhy Would Anyone Question Vaccines?\nWhen my biological kids were born (and after our adopted children became American citizens and Oklahoma residents), their pediatrician gave them the standard CDC vaccination protocol corresponding to their year of birth (2002–2004). Though the large number of syringes on the nurse’s tray being emptied into chunky little thighs and arms made me nervous—I knew of the possibility for vaccine injury—I never really questioned the process. I had carefully interviewed the physician who would be their pediatrician. I believed I had done my due diligence.\nEvery year, the kids had their well-baby visits and were given booster vaccinations as necessary.\nOnce school aged, in order to be enrolled in their zip-code-assigned public school, state law required them to be current on their vaccination schedule. This included vaccines for chicken pox (Varicella), Hepatitis A and B.\nAlthough I was conditioned to accept the Polio, MMR, and DPT vaccines, these additions had always frustrated me. From 1997 to 1999, I was employed as an epidemiologist with the Oklahoma State Department of Health. During that time, the state was becoming convinced of the need to require Varicella and Hep A vaccinations for children.\nWe epidemiologists (in charge of studying disease outbreaks) often discussed the very rare percentages of children and/or adults experiencing severe reactions from either Varicella or Hep A (mainly the immunocompromised and elderly), and it made little sense to me that the state should suddenly decide to force vaccinations for these diseases on children as a necessity to attend school.\nIt still doesn’t—and here’s why.\nHepatitis A\nThe OSDH School Vaccination sheet for parents explains that about 100 people a year die from hepatitis A, and that some infected persons may not even have symptoms of the disease. The population of the United States is over 324 million. Thus, the instance of death of Hepatitis A in the United States is 0.00000031 or 0.000031% of the total population. Does that warrant a vaccine?\nChicken Pox\nWe’re told chicken pox is “usually mild, but it can lead to severe skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), and even death”. We’re not given the instance in the population, but several sources confirm an average of 100 chicken pox deaths before 1995 when the vaccine was introduced. Once again, we are forcing a vaccine on parents for a disease significant for three-hundred thousandths of the population?\nRelatedly, the CDC has confirmed a near doubling of the incidence of shingles since 1993 (shingles is a variant of the chicken pox virus). A current theory is that, because most children no longer get chicken pox, their parents no longer get an immunological boost from the disease and their immune system ‘forgets’ how to fight it. For anyone with shingles – this is a significant issue.\nHepatitis B\nHep B symptoms are usually mild. Chronic liver infection can occur, but the older the person is at the time of infection, the less likely that risk.\nAccording to the National Vaccine Information Center, Hep B is neither common in the US, nor highly contagious. But because it can be spread from mothers infected by IV drug use or sexual contact to their babies, the CDC advised it should be given to ALL babies/children in the US beginning in 1991.\nThere have been 11,052 serious adverse events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) in connection with Hep B vaccines since 1990 – a disease that only affects a subset of the total population. Why would this vaccine be mandated for school children when only those within a specific subset of the population are affected—especially in light of the recorded associated vaccine injuries?\nIs it because it’s easier to remove an individual’s right to make healthcare choice than take CDC and/or state Epidemiologists away from number crunching at their computers and put them into the field to actually study disease process?\nThere’s a Lot of Nuance to This Topic\nIn a recent Federalist article—“No, Anti-Vaxxer Robert Kennedy Jr. Won’t Be Trump’s ‘Vaccine Czar’”—author Julie Kelly states that “collective alarm” was raised as then-President-elect Trump met with RFK Jr. She continues, “The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children…”\nIt’s possible this writer doesn’t know that in 1995, the CDC recommended approximately 20 doses of 5 vaccinations from birth to 18 years of age, but by 2013, that number had expanded to 50 doses of 14 vaccinations from birth to 18.\nThat doesn’t seem a bit much—especially for small children with new and developing immune systems? Especially when the newest recommendations contain vaccinations for illnesses that are neither highly infectious, nor have a high mortality rate?\nI’ve already discussed three of those vaccines. But let’s take a couple more: the HPV and Gardasil vaccine, and the meningitis vaccine.\nHPV/Gardasil\nAccording to the CDC, 6.2 million new sexually transmitted Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) cases are identified each year. Of all cases, 70 percent clear within a year. Ninety percent clear within two. Apparently, an avoidance of casual sex would solve the problem of initial infection—as would monogamous sex. In addition, regular yearly PAP smears would alleviate cancer risk.\nVAERS reports 37,474 vaccine reactions to Gardasil since September 2015, including 209 deaths.\nThough a cervical cancer survivor, I would NEVER recommend HPV vaccination to anyone, including my own daughters, based on both the etiology of the disease and the vaccination risk.\nMeningitis\nMeningitis is an inflammation of the brain which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Though symptoms for all these variants are similar, four vaccines are currently used to combat bacterial meningitis, commonly called meningococcal disease. Meningitis is passed via saliva primarily and can be treated by antibiotics if identified quickly, but can be physically debilitating or deadly if not treated soon enough.\nAccording to the CDC, “Today, meningococcal disease is at a historic low in the United States. Rates of meningococcal disease have been declining in the United States since the 1990s, with much of the decline seen before the routine use of meningococcal vaccines” (emphasis added).\nIn 2013, there were only 550 total meningococcal cases. The CDC reports 8,594 VAERS events in conjunction with vaccine MenACWY-D between 2005 and 2011, including 24 deaths and 284 VAERS events with MenACWY-CRM, including one death.\nPlease note the fact that while there are only approximately 550 cases per year, there have been 1,480 vaccine events per year. Additional risk is apparent when HPV and Meningococcal vaccines are administered together.\nDrug interaction is a known issue—it’s the reason doctors must know the medications and supplements their patients are taking before they write them a prescription.\nIs it really so outrageous to believe that the possible combinations from giving a child 50 doses of 14 different vaccines couldn’t cause health issues? Just the list of contraindications for today’s vaccines should generate at least some level of deep thought before offering up that thigh, arm, or hip to a syringe.\nFearmongering Doesn’t Make Responsible Citizens\nAcross the United States, legislators are attempting to pass laws forcing parents to vaccinate their children and/or removing existing exemptions from current vaccine laws. Citing “public safety,” law makers such as Oklahoma’s state Sen. Irvin Yen seek to remove parental choice in vaccination based on the argument that diseases once eradicated—such as polio—will return.\nLike Yen, author Kelly blames “anti-vaccine activism” for outbreaks of measles and whooping cough, yet neither Kelly nor Yen cite their reasoning.\nCuriously, both Kelly and Yen seem unaware of the influx of undocumented immigrants pouring into this country daily from countries with very low vaccination rates and high instances of diseases such as whooping cough and mumps. In fact, the CDC studies rates of disease in incoming legal immigrants and reported in 2009, that 104,954 immigrants were identified as having a “medical condition” to include tuberculosis, and then admitted “the majority of immigrant records (approximately 400K) are not collected.”\nParents Aren’t Solely Responsible for Outbreaks\nA recent mumps outbreak in Oklahoma spanned 8 counties, yet the highest rates of illness (66 percent) were in the vaccinated population. No vaccine confers 100 percent disease immunity, and mumps vaccine is only 88 percent effective after two doses, leaving 12 percent of the population at risk following disease exposure. Though the origination of the outbreak is unknown, the Arkansas Department of Health also reported nearly 100 confirmed cases—an indication of interstate mobility.\nThe median age in this outbreak was 16. Because adults often have little immunity from diseases vaccinated against in childhood, this significant part of the population can also contract and/or pass illness.\nIn addition, many vaccines given today contain live virus. Anyone taking a live virus vaccine can ‘shed’ the disease to others as their immune system ramps up to create antibodies against the disease. Unvaccinated persons in physical contact with a shedding vaccinated person can become ill.\nConsidering these factors, blaming parents whose children didn’t take the MMR for this—or any—mumps outbreak simply doesn’t add up.\nNot Anti-Vax, But Pro-Informed Consent\nLet me be clear. I believe parents in the United States should protect the health of their children by vaccinating them against highly infectious diseases with high mortality and/or morbidity rates. Vaccinations against polio, whooping cough, measles, diphtheria, and rubella have prevented untold thousands of deaths and health complications in this country over the decades and this fact is nothing to—excuse the term—“sneeze at.”\nThat said, every physician or health department responsible for vaccinating children should provide parents with all the facts about every vaccine before a needle pierces skin. Few do, and that raises a red flag. Why shouldn’t parents receive all information necessary to make an informed decision about their child’s health?\nToday’s parents are getting savvy. They’re beginning to find that government doesn’t have all the answers. They don’t want half-baked “experts” telling them what to do. Let’s face it— if the USDA created the food pyramid to help out farm concerns, and the CDC bought into it, what does that say about the government’s ability to use science independently? Why not exercise some healthy skepticism about CDC vaccine recommendations?\nStrident physicians and lawmakers unwilling to address concerns about vaccine safety don’t create public trust—especially when rampant anecdotal (and factual) information is easily found on the internet.\nState health departments and legislators who sneer at parental concerns and call for vaccination mandates erode parents’ trust. That makes them less likely to vaccinate, which in turn makes government officials push vaccines all the more. This vicious cycle is good for no one.",

         "The mother of a one-year-old killed in a Cuban clinic after receiving a routine vaccination launched an awareness campaign Tuesday urging social media users to share a photo of her in the hope that the communist regime gives her answers.\nCuba’s health ministry initially vowed an investigation into Paloma Dominguez Caballero’s death; last week, state media published a report essentially absolving the government of any wrongdoing, categorically stating that nothing was wrong with the vaccine Dominguez received.\nDominguez was one of five children identified to have an intense “adverse” reaction to a routine measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination at the same Havana clinic between the days of October 7-8. Dominguez was the only one the Castro regime identified as having lost her life after receiving the MMR vaccine. Dominguez died on October 9.\nCuba’s healthcare system has been dangerously ill-equipped to provide for the Cuban people for decades. Cuba sends its best doctors to work for free around the world in a “slave doctor” system that nets the regime as much as $11 billion a year while investing minimally in its healthcare system at home. The “slave doctor” program also serves as propaganda touting Cuba’s alleged advances in medicine, regurgitated religiously by Western socialists seeking to impose state-run healthcare systems in their own countries. The Cuban healthcare system is also rapidly running out of basic medicine because the economy it exploits to keep afloat, that of Venezuela, is also collapsing under the weight of socialist mismanagement.\nCuban doctors who denounce the shortcomings of the communist healthcare system often find themselves imprisoned.\nMother Yaima Caballero posted several messages on her Instagram account – previously dedicated to posting photos and videos of Paloma Dominguez – explaining her decision to continue to pressure the Castro regime for a precise explanation on what killed her daughter, Diario de Cuba reported on Tuesday.\n“Many people are helping me protest using the internet, it is the only thing I can do now. But the person making this happen suggests that I ask friends who want to help me to change their profile pictures and use the one of my baby with the wings,” she wrote. “This is not easy for me, but [it is] at least something, to put pressure on at all sides. Please, do it for her, not for me, change their profile photos in all your accounts and help me with this photo of her. Let’s start there.”\nShe then posted the photo she wished social media users would share of her late daughter.\n“Join my protest and make this your profile photo on all social media, please let those sons of whores who killed my girl see it and wherever they look, let them see this picture,” she wrote. “Let them see her to see if it reaches someplace and they do something for us and for her. This photo and along with it the word ‘justice.'”\nThe top comment in response to her post reads, “I recommend that you consider leaving the country soon the government will block your accounts and isolate you on the internet. I hope to God I keep seeing you and find out what happened.”\nCaballero has no publicly known record of opposition to the communist regime. Cuba punishes anyone who publicly disagrees with or criticizes the regime under the crime of desacato, or “contempt.” Cuban state police also routinely arrest and disappear dissidents without offering them or their families any reason for doing so.\nCaballero has previously accused the government of “killing” Dominguez in social media messages posted in the immediate aftermath of her death, when reports indicated that as many as 24 children were affected and another had died. Cuba’s Public Health Ministry has since clarified that only five children are officially documented as having been affected and only Dominguez died, though Havana has a long history of falsifying medical records to appear to have a more successful healthcare system before the world than it actually has. Cuban slave doctors that have escaped the system have said that, while working abroad, the Castro regime forced them to invent patients and throw away perfectly good medicine to boost the statistics on the number of patients Cuban doctors actually treat. Cuba has for years also faced accusations of officially labeling stillborn children “abortions” to claim one of the world’s lowest infant mortality rates.\nCubaDebate, a state media outlet, published an alleged explanation for Dominguez’s death last week that identified no wrongdoing on the part of any medical staff or any cause of death for the child. It did provide more details on what Dominguez’s last moments were like: vomiting, fever, swelling in the area of the vaccine, and toxic shock.\n“The vaccine is not the problem,” Rafael Pérez Cristiá, the head of the Cuban Center for State Control of Medicines, Equipment, and Medical Devices (CECMED), is quoted as saying in the report. “It is a triple viral vaccine that protects against three grave disease which, thanks to its use, are now eliminated in the country.”\nThe CECMED authorities, whose responsibility it is to ensure that faulty vaccines are not administered in the country, said the vaccine that killed Dominguez was part of a package of 43,630 doses that did not otherwise hurt children outside of the one clinic in which the five identified cases occurred. They do not explain why Dominguez died, hinting that her disposition was too delicate for the vaccine, but not explaining how no doctor identified this vulnerability.\nThe report includes an infographic encouraging parents to continue receiving the MMR vaccine with confidence.\nIn the West, the MMR vaccine has been falsely linked with autism, in part because the signs of autism tend to appear at the age of 1. “Vaccine safety experts, including experts at CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), agree that MMR vaccine is not responsible for increases in the number of children with autism,” the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) affirms.\nOutside of the West, particularly in Africa, measles has become increasingly common as locals do not trust Western-based aid groups administering vaccines and ongoing paramilitary conflicts keep health workers from delivering vaccines. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – currently enduring the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history – is also experiencing a measles outbreak, also the world’s worst known ongoing outbreak of any disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",

         "As Congress begins debating the Equality Act, the Heritage Foundation warns that if the bill becomes law it will prove the death knell for women’s sports.\nThe House is voting on the Equality Act (H.R. 5) this week which, in the words of Duke Professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman, “will be the end of girl’s and women’s only sports,” Heritage reported.\n#TitleIX required schools to establish separate women's sports teams to receive federal funding. That increased funding led to an explosion in female participation—from 1 in 27 girls before Title IX to 2 in 5 girls now—a 900% increase. And the benefits should be obvious… — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) May 16, 2019\nBut Congress will vote this week on the #EqualityAct, which in the words of Duke Professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman \"will be the end of girl's and women's only sports.\" Here's how: https://t.co/MigGwDsZFv — Heritage Foundation (@Heritage) May 16, 2019\nTitle IX required schools to establish separate women’s sports teams for federal funding, but the Equality Act will seriously undermine that, Heritage added.\n“The Equality Act would redefine sex in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, basing it not on biology, but on self-perceived gender identity,” Emilie Kao wrote.\nKao went on to note that women’s sports has already been undermined by the transgender movement.\nFemale athletes nationwide are already losing to males who argue that sex-segregated sports is unfair discrimination. But athletes who identify as the opposite sex aren’t excluded from competing against their physical equals. Instead, they are seeking to compete in categories created to provide an equal playing field for all athletes.\nSome female athletes have spoken out about the transgender movement as it affects women’s sports.\nWorld-record runner Paula Radcliffe said that opening women’s sports to men who “self-identify” as women necessarily cuts women out “due to the added numbers achieving” women’s records.\n“The Equality Act isn’t about including those who were unfairly excluded from sports. It’s about meeting the demands of a powerful political group for unfair advantage. This politicizes sports, and there is no clear limit to where that will end,” Kao writes.\nIf one athlete can identify as the opposite sex, then why can’t another identify as a different age? The unfairness of allowing someone born with male physiology to compete against women should be as obvious as that of allowing adults to compete against children. Fairness requires that rules be based on physical realities. The Civil Rights Act addressed the illegitimate exclusion from educational opportunities on the basis of an immutable characteristic race. But in sports, sex and age are two legitimate categories upon which rules should be based. Sex differences determine performance.\nTo wrap up her piece, Kao noted that the level of testosterone that naturally occurs in women “(2.4 nanomoles per liter (npl)) does not even reach the floor for men’s testosterone levels (10 npl).”\n“We should treat people suffering gender dysphoria with compassion and respect. But that doesn’t mean legislators should pass laws that put female athletes at such a disadvantage,” she said.\nIt comes down to a choice between politics and sports. Supporters of the Equality Act should listen to the female high school runners in Connecticut who describe losing to transgender athletes as “heartbreaking.” Will Congress turn the clock back by denying these girls the opportunity to compete against their own sex? Or can we keep politics out of sports so both men and women can play to win?\nThere are a few voices in women’s sports finally speaking out about transgenderism in sports.\nTennis great Martina Navratilova, for instance, has criticized the idea.\n“Letting men compete as women simply if they change their name and take hormones is unfair — no matter how those athletes may throw their weight around,” Navratilova said of transgender players’ efforts to be recognized under their “chosen” gender.\nBritish Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies also slammed the concept of transgender athletes.\n“I just don’t understand how anyone can say this is a level & fair playing field,” Davies tweeted. “1000% increase in trans women taking part in sport recently. It’s a serious topic that has to be honestly dealt with for safety as much as integrity #fairplay.”\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.",

         "WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden promised black community leaders in Delaware on Monday he would earn their support amid nationwide police brutality protests, saying he would create a police oversight board within his first 100 days in the White House.\nBiden, who met with more than a dozen black leaders in a church in Wilmington, also said he would soon unveil an economic plan to deal with the disproportionate toll on the black and Latino communities from the coronavirus outbreak.\n“I’ve never taken you for granted,” Biden, who visited a protest site on Sunday, told the leaders after sitting quietly and taking note of their concerns. “It has to be earned, earned every single time.”\nCities across the country awoke from a smoldering weekend of violent protests over race and policing sparked by the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody last Monday.\nBiden said his economic plan would include components on housing, education and access to capital in the black community.\n“We’re going to make sure that the economic recovery deals with the institutional structures, the institutional racism,” said Biden, who wore a mask as he listened and pulled it down to talk.\nBiden’s appearance was a contrast with the approach of Republican President Donald Trump, who has made no major public statement to address the growing crisis but issued tweets as he remained out of sight in the White House. He was due on Monday to meet his top law enforcement officer and hold a call with governors, law enforcement and national security officials.\nThe community leaders at Wilmington’s Bethel AME Church urged Biden to pick a black vice presidential running mate, and said the protests were a reflection of frustration about the lack of attention and resources for African-American communities.\n“Young people out there are going mad” from a lack of effort to address their problems, said Bishop Thomas Wesley Weeks, pastor at New Destiny Fellowship in Wilmington. Weeks and others said the choice of a black running mate would show Biden’s commitment to one of the Democratic Party’s most loyal constituencies.\n“A black female will overwhelm and excite and turn the heads of these young people and everybody out there,” Weeks said.\nBiden, who has promised his No. 2 will be a woman, told the group several black women were on his list of potential running mates.\nLast month, Biden apologized for telling a black radio host that he “ain’t black” if he was still weighing whether to support him or Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.\nSlideshow (3 Images)\nBiden has chafed at being stuck in his Delaware home during the coronavirus outbreak, and a Biden adviser said there was an internal divide on whether to get Biden out on the trail, with his wife Jill resisting.\n“I can tell you with confidence that Joe wants to get out there, Jill doesn’t want him too. She knows her husband and it’s impossible for him not hug or handshake,” the adviser said.\nFloyd’s death was the latest in a string of similar incidents involving unarmed black men in recent years that have raised an outcry over excessive police force and racism.",

The proposed law first opens up Pell Grants to institutions that provide job training or other alternative certifications and instructs the Department of Education to create a certification pathway for such institutions. The second measure dramatically takes aim at student loan debt by requiring higher education institutions to pay off 50 percent of the balance of student loans for those who attended their institution and end up in default. The bill also prohibits them from increasing the cost of attendance.\n“There’s no reason we should only be privileging those students who want to go to traditional 4 year institutions,” Hawley told Hill.TV in a phone interview. “We need to allow these opportunities in the form of these tax dollars to follow these students into other opportunities, other outlets that will help them get the skills they need to get the career path that’s right for them.”\nHawley said in the Hill.TV interview that the bill was “meant to address the concentration of power that has accumulated in the higher education space” and added that “many of them have built massive endowments that has been enabled by federal tax dollars” and that the institutions “have gobbled those up and raised tuition so students have not benefited at all.”\n“It’s time we address that concentration of power by creating a completely alternative pathway that students could choose that would give them options that are right for them,” Hawley said.\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.",

         "Kolfage’s wall charity has erected a half-mile segment of fencing on what it says is private land in the town of Sunland Park, N.M. That work stopped temporarily when city officials determined that the project violated local zoning laws.\nMayor Receives Death Threats\nAfter being told to stop work, WeBuildTheWall used its social media accounts to bully local officials. Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea said he got death threats .\nWall construction resumed after George Cudahy, the landowner, told city officials he just wanted it put up some lights and poles. The city acquiesced with his request.\nBut when city officials realized the wall project had resumed they filed a criminal complaint. Cudahy failed to appear in local court for a hearing on the complaint, which could result in a criminal record and a $500 fine.\nThe project also includes an encroachment on federal land. The International Boundary and Water Commission ordered Kolfage’s charity to act, but nothing happened.\nThe commission said in a statement that WeBuildTheWall “built a gate on federal land in Sunland Park, N.M., near El Paso, Texas, without authority, and then locked the gate closed on June 6, 2019. The private gate blocks a levee road owned by the U.S. Government. After repeated requests to unlock and open the private gate, the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC), accompanied by two uniformed law enforcement officers from the Dona Ana County Sheriff’s Office, removed the private lock, opened the gate, and locked the gate open pending further discussions with We Build the Wall.”\nPart of the Wall in Mexico\nThe Mexican government says the wall, or at least part of it, is on Mexican soil.\nSurveyors sent by the Mexican government determined that part of the fence construction sits on the wrong side of the border. Mexican officials said the encroaching materials will have to be removed, which may prove difficult to accomplish.\nThe Trump Administration hasn’t built a single foot of border fencing after thirty months of riling up its supporters with claims that the wall was vital to national security.\nThe latest estimate is that the proposed Mexico border wall would cost nearly $60 billion. That is 3,000 times as much money as the charity said it has raised.\nA wall cannot be built along signification sections of the border with Mexico because of terrain issues, according to federal agencies and others who have studied Trump’s idea.\nTrump, who ran for office saying Mexico would pay for the wall, failed to get any money from Congress in his first two years in office, when Republicans controlled both chambers. Democrats, who now control the House, say they will never fund Trump’s wall.\nThe Washington Post reported that Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) held up one of Trump’s appointees for a post that requires Senate confirmation to encourage the Army Corps of Engineers to hire Fisher Industries to build Trump’s unfunded Mexican border wall.\nFisher Industries, a North Dakota-based company, built the half-mile fencing for Kolfage’s wall charity. It’s unknown if WeBuildTheWall has anything to do with the senator’s efforts.\nKobach’s Role\nThe organization’s general counsel is Kris Kobach, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Kansas who also sits on the wall charity’s board as a director. As Kansas secretary of state, Kobach pushed to remove 20,000 voters from the election rolls, sought strict voter identification requirements and government registration of Muslims. Trump considered naming him his “immigration czar.”",

         "As part of his plan to protect the commonwealth of Virginia from the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, Gov. Ralph Northam determined that citizens should not be allowed to attend church or worship services, but are fine travel to an abortion clinic and undergo an elective procedure like surgical abortion.\nOn Monday, March 23, Northam instituted an executive order making it a criminal offense to hold or attend a church service with more than 10 people.\nThe mandate classifies attending a church service with more than 10 individuals as a class one misdemeanor. Punishment for a class one misdemeanor includes jail time for a maximum of 12 months and a maximum fine of $2,500.\nTwo days later, Wednesday, March 25, Northam directed all hospitals and health care providers to stop performing elective surgeries or procedures in an effort to conserve supply of personal protective equipment and to make space for a potential surge in coronavirus patients. But the governor’s directive exempted “family planning services,” which includes abortion giant Planned Parenthood.\nAccording to Planned Parenthood office in Roanoke, Virginia, the abortion giant will continue to perform abortion services during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming abortion is an “essential” medical service.\nGovernors in other states such as Tennessee, Ohio, and Texas determined an abortion to be an “elective” service. As states work to ensure their ICUs and ERs can handle a surge of coronavirus cases, the goal of temporarily stopping abortion procedures is to prevent women from having to visit contagious ERs, in the event of a botched surgical or chemical abortion. Even women who receive non-surgical or chemical abortions face common side effects like incomplete abortions, hemorrhaging, and infection. These women, especially poor women, ultimately seek treatment in emergency rooms. Some studies have shown that as many as 5 to 7 percent of all women obtaining chemical abortions will require surgical procedures.\nAdditionally, these states want to halt any unnecessary procedures that would divert the use of masks, gloves, and other critical personal protective equipment away from doctors and nurses who desperately need them while treating contagious corona virus patients.\nNortham, who advocated for late term abortion and infanticide in 2019, is more willing to throw Christians or other religious gatherers into jail over meeting with 11 fellow believers than he is to protect to the lives of health care workers and pregnant women.",

         "Countless American believers in the Bible, myself included, were inspired tremendously on Monday when President Trump stood in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, and held up the Word of God for all to see.\nThe historic church was boarded up after rioters set fires there the day before, in an act which made even many on the Left incredulous.\nThe president’s likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired. Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president’s appearance outside the church shows he “is more interested in power than in principle.”\nSome religious leaders found it “baffling and reprehensible” that the St. John Paul II National Shrine would allow the president to visit with First Lady Melania Trump, who is Catholic.\nActually, the opposition to the President’s actions is baffling. Every religious leader should be cheering the president’s expression of faith and commitment to religious liberty.\nBefore the nation became engulfed in violence sparked in part by the death of George Floyd and in large measure by unrelated agendas of violent agitators, the president had planned to sign an executive order on international religious freedom at the John Paul II Center.\n“This was fitting,” according to a statement on the Shrine’s Twitter page, “given John Paul II was a tireless advocate of religious liberty throughout his pontificate.”\nPresident Trump, too, is committed to preserving religious liberty in our nation and in the world but that one unassailable fact is conveniently overlooked by his critics.\nTrump has been a tireless advocate for religious freedom during his presidency, beginning with an executive order close to my heart that he signed during a Rose Garden ceremony in May 2017, just over three months into his term. My colleague Alveda King, who leads our Civil Rights for the Unborn outreach, was there to represent Priests for Life.\nThat order, signed on the National Day of Prayer, loosened restrictions on the Johnson Amendment, which had been needlessly silencing clergy since 1954. President Trump’s Department of Justice backed that up with a memo to the Internal Revenue Service in 2018, ordering agents not to enforce the Johnson Amendment.\nThe order also took the side of Priests for Life against the Obama mandate that every employer must provide abortifacient drugs and devices to their employees. Priests for Life was among dozens of petitioners who challenged that Obama mandate all the way up to the Supreme Court. In 2018, HHS finalized a rule that protected faith-based organizations from that mandate.\nAlso in 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the formation of a new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division in the HHS Office for Civil Rights. President Trump created the office to protect the conscience rights of health-care workers whose religious beliefs do not allow them to take part in abortion or assisted suicide.\nIn 2019, the federal Department of Veterans Affairs allowed Bibles on their premises once again. Also that year, the president lifted a ban on providing federal funds to faith-based black colleges and universities.\nThe president has also endorsed Bible literacy in public schools, defended the rights of students to pray, and defended faith-based adoption agencies that have been under attack for declining to place children in same-sex households.\nHe has looked at every place in our society where religious liberty is threatened, and taken steps to protect it. I have lost track of the number of special actions President Trump’s Administration has taken to make the federal government and public life in general more hospitable to citizens and organizations of Faith.\nIt is absolutely refreshing and inspiring.\nHe continued those efforts this week.\nOn Tuesday, as his visit to a Catholic shrine was being decried in the media, President Trump signed an order that would prioritize religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy.\nThis is a president committed to preserving and protecting the religious liberty every American is guaranteed under the First Amendment, and that everyone in the world is guaranteed by their human dignity.\nDid President Trump have the right to hold a Bible aloft in front of a church? You bet he did.\nThe Democrats, and their media mouthpieces, have gone too far in criticizing the president over what they called a stage-managed photo op. Yet this kind of criticism is more and more characteristic of their party and its leaders.\nIn 2015, failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton infamously said that “deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed” (emphasis mine). These Democrats want to change people’s religious beliefs, and they think they have to right to do that.\nIn his failed bid for the Democrat nomination for 2020, Beto O’Rourke said churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status. In other words, toe the non-Biblical party line or else!\nBiden says he’s a Catholic, goes to Mass on Sunday, and believes that mothers should be able to have their children killed up until their due dates and that U.S. taxpayers should pay for it! During his lackluster campaign, Biden has said “We are in a battle for the soul of this nation.”\nOn this point he is absolutely right. And winning that battle demands keeping these morally misguided Democrats out of office.\nFather Frank Pavone is national director of Priests for Life.",

         "On Tuesday, both the pro- and anti-choice world were rocked by a revelation that undermines literal decades of religious right nonsense. Norma McCorvey, the “Jane Roe” of the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, claimed before her 2017 death that her famous “conversion” to anti-abortion activism was a con job.\nMcCorvey told filmmaker Nick Sweeney during the taping of his new FX documentary, “AKA Jane Roe,” “I took their money, and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”\nFor pro-choice activists, the revelation was less exciting than frustrating. For decades, the anti-abortion movement has held out McCorvey’s “conversion” as a morality tale about how women, deep down inside, really don’t want access to abortion, but instead are being deceived by a supposedly ruthless “abortion industry.”\nMcCorvey was a prop in service of this argument, which depends on sexist stereotypes painting women as too feeble-minded and gullible to be the proper stewards of their own lives. Her tale of woe, where she was fooled into thinking abortion was a right, until she was “saved” by anti-choice ministers like Flip Benham, was all about serving this narrative: Women can’t be trusted with autonomy, and need “godly” men to guide them.\n(Benham, a supposedly wise and “pro-life” guidance-giver to women, has been seen in recent months violating coronavirus restrictions in order to harass patients and staff at a North Carolina clinic, even though doing so directly threatens to spread a deadly disease among the protesters, clinic staff and the pregnant people seeking care.)\nHaving spent years covering the pro-choice movement, I can safely say that the widespread view in pro-choice circles of McCorvey’s “conversion” was one of skepticism. Frankly, she was a sketchy character and that was no secret. She admitted to lying about being raped, even though the pro-choice lawyers who argued Roe had no interest in making the case about rape. McCorvey publicly waged war on Sarah Weddington, the pro-choice lawyer who argued the Roe case before the Supreme Court, apparently furious that Weddington didn’t try to help her get an illegal abortion during the run-up to Roe. McCorvey didn’t seem to care that if Weddington had committed a crime on her behalf, it could have ended a case that granted millions of women the right to an abortion without the threat of jail.\nSo yeah, pro-choicers always suspected McCorvey was getting paid off somehow, and the number that Sweeney uncovers — nearly half a million dollars over the years — sounds about right.\nBut the main reason pro-choicers suspected the McCorvey conversion was a sham wasn’t about McCorvey’s character, but about the dynamics of the anti-choice movement in general. It’s no exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with liars and grifters. Their entire raison d’être is telling lies — often over-the-top, melodramatic lies — in service of sticking it to women, LGBT people and liberals in general for not respecting the “right” of the religious right to dominate the rest of us.\nThe anti-choice movement has always been run by lying trolls, and always will be. They set the template for the rest of the conservative movement, and paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, whose presidential victory was a perfect summary of the fact that right-wing American politics has become one big, long con.\nThe over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed.\nFor instance, over the past few years anti-choice activists have begun to claim that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way. (Stanek has also argued that contraception bans are necessary to force people to have sex only within marriage.)\nTo bolster this argument, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion. Did they? Probably not! The procedures they describe have no relationship to actual methods used to terminate pregnancies in the real world. Anti-choice “testimony” is all to often as McCorvey described it: “[T]hey took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say.”\nBut this “born alive” mania has mostly been ignored by the mainstream media, except for occasional gawking at Trump’s weird rally stories. I suspect that happens because these tales are so grotesque and improbable that journalists fear their audiences will think they made it all up. Instead, anti-choice activists get a glow-up in mainstream coverage, presented as less hysterical and less prone to lies and bizarre flights of fancy than they actually are.\nThe “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists.\nA series of “undercover” videos purporting to “prove” that clinics like Planned Parenthood were secretly selling “baby parts” out the back door were released by an anti-choice activist named David Daleiden in 2015. To anyone familiar with the anti-choice movement and their reliance on fantastical stories, it was obvious this would turn out to be bullshit, but too many mainstream media organizations ran credulous stories, bamboozled by their own decades of coverage falsely painting anti-choicers as serious-minded people instead of fundamentalist whackadoodles.\nSure enough, after the first round of credulous coverage, the facts started to emerge: Planned Parenthood doesn’t sell baby parts.” They donate fetal tissue to clinics that use it for medical research — research that saves far more lives than any nut waving a bloody fetus poster board has ever saved. The videos had been altered to make innocent people look guilty. Eventually, Planned Parenthood won a lawsuit against Daleiden and he was arrested for counterfeiting government documents.\nThis myth of the humble, righteous anti-choice activist works its way not just into the media but into Supreme Court cases, such as one in 2014 case, when anti-choice activists argued against an anti-protest buffer zone around clinics by claiming they were merely “sidewalk counselors” trying to “help” women.\nAn investigation by Jill Filipovic at Cosmopolitan exposed the truth: They’re a bunch of bullies who are angry at women for having sex and show up at clinics to harass them.\n“If women want careers and education and everything and they don’t want children,” one protester complained to Filipovic, “what are they doing having sex?”\nAnother complained that “there were no problems” back when women “had to be obedient to their husbands.”\nInstead of contraception, a protester argued, “the way to control [pregnancy] is not to hop into bed with every Tom, Dick, and Harry.”\nThe court sided with the bullies, unsurprisingly, elevating the myth that these belligerent protesters merely wished to “counsel” women.\nAnti-choicers have long pushed this myth that they’re righteous warriors going up against a sleazy “abortion industry” and trying to “save” women. This is pure projection on their part, and a complete inversion of reality.\nIn truth, the pro-choice movement exists to help women, and the anti-choice movement exists to strip them of their rights and subjugate them both legally and socially. The pro-choice movement stands with science and medical facts, while the anti-choice movement is rife with liars and grifters, and spews a dizzying amount of propaganda based on nothing but misogyny and lurid fantasy.\nThe press should stop being fooled by the way anti-choicers hide behind the Bible and the cross and see them for who they are: Bullies who are trying to take important medical care away from women at a vulnerable moment in their lives. Perhaps the revelation that anti-choicers literally bought off Norma McCorvey and paid her to lie will help open up some eyes.\nBut it’s also important to step back and take a look at the bigger picture. Roe v. Wade was never about Norma McCorvey. She was simply the plaintiff recruited for a case that was actually about the rights of millions of people who have faced or will face a pregnancy they don’t want or can’t bring to term, for whatever reason. By recruiting McCorvey to their side, anti-choice activists sought to erase the existence of these millions of people who have been saved by access to safe, legal abortion. It’s a shame that McCorvey betrayed all those people for so long. But at least before she died, she told the truth.",

         "Shelby Steele, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution said Friday that the contemporary civil rights movement under the banner of “Black Lives Matter” was deeply unserious, catering to an old form of victimization that has accomplished nothing to lift up black people.\n“There’s a pathos here. It’s like we’ve done this too many times. We’ve been here too many times, we’ve seen this kind of thing and there’s a big hallabaloo and then it sort of fades away and this is already beginning I think to fade. What was it all about? What was the point? What did these various groups, what did they want?” Steele asked on Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier.\n“Striking to me is that about this particular one is that there was not even a list of demands. Usually there’s always a long, elaborate list of demands. That wasn’t the case here. There’s nothing that you could come away from, this entire episode, the last two weeks or so that’s meaningful,” he said.\nBaier then asked Steele about remarks delivered by Reverend Al Sharpton Thursday at Floyd’s memorial service in Minneapolis.\n“George Floyd’s story has been the story of black folks because ever since 401 years ago, the reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our necks,” Sharpton said.\n“He went on to say that this is the moment and repeated the systemic racism in this country. Your response to that?” Baier asked.\n“Al Sharpton is the master of this old form of politics that comes out of the ’60s where we as blacks cry victimization and demand the larger society give us things of some kind or another,” Steele said.\nI don’t take Al Sharpton seriously. I know him, he’s a nice person. I will take his message here seriously when he stands before a congregation like that, a black people in America over a tragic event and says what black Americans can do to get out of the situation that we’re in. No one from the president on down anywhere says what role, what’s going on with black America? Why are they so dependent on white America, on the government. That all they can think of is themselves as victims which of course deflates themselves as human beings, undermines their best energies, their best intentions, and so after 50, 60 years now past the civil rights bill, we’re worse off than many socioeconomic categories than we were.\nSteele went on to explain that this African-American dependency emerged out of white Americans desperately seeking to prove themselves as non-racist.\n“White Americans live under this accusation that they’re not racist. They need to prove that they’re not racist. In order to prove that you’re not racist, you need to take over the fate of black people and say, go with us, we’ll engineer you into the future. We’ll engineer you into equality,” Steele said. “Life doesn’t work like that. We have to engineer ourselves. Period. There is no other way.”\nBaier pushed back on Steele’s assertion about an absence of demands from today’s Black Lives Matter movement, including the destruction of law enforcement and reparation payments to African-American communities.\n“Is there a solution out there that politically you can get your head around?” Baier asked.\n“I will take those things seriously when I also hear from Sharpton and others the argument that we need within the black community to work on the institution of marriage,” Steele said, citing the fact that 75 percent of black children are born out of wedlock with no father.\n“I don’t care how many social programs you have. You’re not going to overcome that.”",

         "While most of the world hungers for a vaccine to put an end to the death and economic destruction wrought by COVID-19, some anti-vaccine groups are joining with anti-lockdown protesters to challenge restrictions aimed at protecting public health.\nVaccine critics suffered serious setbacks in the past year, as states strengthened immunization laws in response to measles outbreaks sparked by vaccine refusers. California tightened its vaccine requirements last fall despite protests during which anti-vaccine activists threw blood on state senators, assaulted the vaccine bill’s sponsor and shut down the legislature.\nNow, many of these same vaccine critics are joining a fight against stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which had killed more than 47,000 Americans as of Thursday afternoon.\n“This is just a fresh coat of paint for the anti-vaccine movement in America, and an exploitative means for them to try to remain relevant,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\nHotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause.\n“Unfortunately, their strategy may work.”\nA group calling itself the Freedom Angels, whose members last year stood on chairs and chanted at public hearings on the California vaccine bill, say governors are abusing their power by shutting down gun shops and other businesses.\nMany anti-vaccine activists — who have claimed that diseases such as measles aren’t that serious — now contend the coronavirus isn’t dangerous enough to justify staying home. They agree with President Donald Trump that the “cure” for the pandemic could be worse than the disease itself.\nThat’s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters — whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter — in staging demonstrations in state capitals to “reopen America.”\n“This is the time for people to take notice and really evaluate the freedoms they’re giving up, all in the name of perceived safety,” said Freedom Angels co-founder Heidi Munoz Gleisner in a Facebook video.\nThe group organized a Monday rally in Sacramento called “Operation Gridlock.”\n“People need to get back to work, get back to life, get back into contact with their loved ones who they’re isolated from, they need to be able to have a paycheck,” group co-founder Tara Thornton told The Sacramento Bee, which interviewed her during the demonstration. “This is the grounds they will enslave us upon.”\nFreedom Angels did not respond to requests for interviews. The group’s website mentions plans for additional rallies and includes photos from Monday’s demonstration, such as one in which a protester holds a sign proclaiming “No Mandatory Vaccines.”\nBut after the Monday event, the California Highway Patrol announced it had revoked the group’s permit for future protests because the gathering — which included dozens of people — violated the governor’s social distancing order. The highway patrol has now banned all group events at the Capitol during the pandemic to avoid spreading the coronavirus.\nA big tent\nThe anti-vaccine movement has never been limited to one political party. Left-leaning vaccine critics — such as Children’s Health Defense, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — include environmentalists who are suspicious of chemical pollutants, corporations and “Big Pharma.” The Kennedy group’s website attacks Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for rushing “risky and uncertain coronavirus vaccines” into development as part of a “sweetheart deal” for drug companies.\nOn the other side of the political spectrum, many anti-vaccine conservatives oppose state immunization requirements because they distrust “big government.”\nA group called Texans for Vaccine Choice has called on the governor to promise that no one will be forced to get a coronavirus vaccine in order to go to work or school.\nPosts on the Facebook page of Californians for Health Choice, which also opposed California’s vaccine laws, question stay-at-home orders and accuse government officials of refusing to admit the orders are a mistake.\nIn a video on the Freedom Angels’ Facebook page, its founders describe stay-at-home orders as an abuse of government authority, and the closure of California gun shops as an assault on the Second Amendment. The group notes that guns could be essential for protection from rioters and looters looking to steal food during the pandemic.\nIn many ways, the conservative arm of the anti-vaccine movement is a natural ally for those leading “reopen America” rallies, said Dr. David Gorski, an oncologist and managing editor of the Science-Based Medicine site. Both harbor suspicions about government authority.\nVaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said. Trump has at times linked vaccines with autism, although he came out strongly in favor of vaccinations during the 2019 measles epidemic.\nAnti-vaccine groups are now rebranding themselves as advocates of “medical freedom.”\nProtests against social distancing began in Michigan but have spread to state capitols in Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Maryland, Wisconsin and elsewhere, with more planned. Most protests have been small, limited to a few hundred or fewer people.\nYet the anti-vaccine movement doesn’t speak for everyone on the right.\nStephen Moore, the senior economic contributor for FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group that has been helping publicize the protests, said he’s unfamiliar with the Freedom Angels or their rallies.\n“I’m personally pro-vaccine,” said Moore, a member of the White House council to reopen the economy. “Especially when it comes to coronavirus.”\nAnd some heroes of the anti-vaccine movement say they support coronavirus lockdowns.\nDr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica, California, pediatrician popular among vaccine foes for downplaying the risks of measles, said the risk of COVID-19 is real. Gordon said he approves of the lockdown, “and we have to keep it up.”\nContaining the pandemic\nDr. Richard Pan, a pediatrician and California state senator who has championed stronger vaccine mandates, described anti-vaccine and anti-lockdown protesters as “essentially selfish” because they put other people at risk.\n“One of the hallmarks of the anti-vaccine movement is this sense of selfishness and lack of concern for other people’s health,” Pan said. “They like to talk about rights and freedom. But what they really want is freedom without consequences.”\nBoth anti-vaccine parents and those who want to relax social distancing assume that the medical system will come to their rescue if they become sick, said Pan, who noted that thousands of health care workers have died while fighting the pandemic.\nFauci has said that relaxing stay-at-home orders is dangerous as long as the virus — for which there are no approved treatments or vaccines — is actively spreading. Reopening businesses too soon could spark a second wave of infections.\nMore than 75 companies and research groups worldwide are trying to develop vaccines, which are seen as a key weapon against the novel coronavirus.\nIn the meantime, the CDC says that social distancing measures — such as working from home and avoiding large gatherings — are critical to slowing the spread of the coronavirus and preventing patients from overwhelming hospitals. Health leaders say it won’t be safe to reopen the county until widespread testing shows the coronavirus has died down.\nAmericans overwhelmingly support vaccination, according to surveys, and polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 80% of Americans want lockdowns to continue. Only 19% said social distancing orders placed an unnecessary burden on the economy. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\nNeither the anti-vaccine nor anti-lockdown demonstrators represent the opinions of most Americans, Pan said.\n“Let’s put this movement into proper context,” he said. “They’re loud, they’re noisy and they’re small.”",

         "The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”\nThis sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.\nThis argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.\nThe Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.\nHer ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.\nThe author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”\nThis shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.\nThis is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.\nI am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.\nLooking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.\nIn contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.\nBearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.\nOf course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.\nIt was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.",

         "The government of Ireland is preparing to ban the registration of new petrol and diesel cars by the year 2030 as a part of its “Climate Action Plan”.\nDrivers in Ireland will be forced to buy electric vehicles within ten years according to a new law by the left-wing government in Dublin.\nBy banning the registration of new petrol and diesel cars the government aims to have one-third of the cars on Irish roads be powered by electric batteries, totalling some 936,000 electric vehicles and hybrids, reports RTE.\nThe initiative is part of a broader campaign to avert a ‘climate apocalypse‘ by making Ireland carbon neutral by the year 2050.\nThe Minister of the Environment, Richard Bruton said: “I think people need to recognise that if they are considering a purchase over the next couple of years, not everyone will be buying this year but they should increasingly assess electric as an alternative. It may be dearer upfront but its running cost over its lifetime compensates for much of that extra cost upfront.”\nDelingpole: Tesla Car Batteries Not Remotely Green, Study Findshttps://t.co/Ob1I7redyC pic.twitter.com/kPLoxYNbod — Breitbart Tech (@BreitbartTech) June 22, 2017\nAt the launch of the proposal in June, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the government’s goal was to introduce “nudge” policies including tax hikes to incentivise citizens to adopt the government’s prefered lifestyle.\n“Our approach will be to nudge people and businesses to change behaviour and adopt new technologies through incentives, disincentives, regulations and information,” the left-wing leader said.\n“We are going to change how electricity is produced and consumed, how our homes and workplaces are heated; the way we travel; the types of vehicles we purchase; and how food is produced”, added Varadkar.\nDirector of the Copenhagen Consensus Center, Bjørn Lomborg wrote last week that while electric vehicles are “branded as environmentally friendly,” the reality is that the energy that electric batteries require “almost always involves burning fossil fuels”.\n“Despite subsidies of about $10,000 per car, battery-powered electric cars represent less than one-third of 1% of the world’s 1 billion vehicles. The IEA estimates that with sustained political pressure and subsidies, electric cars could account for 15% of the much larger global fleet in 2040, but it notes that this increase in share will reduce global CO2 emissions by just 1%”, Lomborg added.\nPolice Wasted £1.5 Million on Electric Cars That Can’t Chase Criminals https://t.co/ORDSTD9PfI — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 26, 2019\nFollow Kurt on Twitter at @KurtZindulka",

         "It’s one thing to oppose the grandiose “Green New Deal” as gratuitously imprecise or for its full-throated attack on all-things-ozone and carbon release in our global community.\nIt feels like something totally other to oppose narrow regulations that could advance the campaign to swap out incandescent light bulbs for light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, a small, practical step that, multiplied into the millions, would passively remove a healthy chunk of energy-eating pollution over time.\nActually, I was surprised to see a recent editorial about all this in The Washington Post, which argued that “Of all the counterproductive policy campaigns conservatives have waged in recent years, among the most irrational has been their war on the federal government’s efforts to update the light bulb.”\nLots of politicians and critics across the board have attacked the Green New Deal proposed last week by freshman Democrats Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Such rivals as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw overstepping in the name of climate change, a blown campaign rollout to even explain all of its aspirational aspects, and, more generally, a need to slap down an unruly first-year Democratic Socialist. McConnell scornfully said he would call for an immediate vote on the resolution even before details could be discussed, just to have it swept away.\nI understand a president so disdainful of the whole idea of climate change, but what baffles me is why he wants to make things worse.\nSo, I understand that our politicians want practical over primacy—unless you are discussing border security—and I even understand, sort of, a president who is just so disdainful of the whole idea of climate change as to not discuss what to do about it. But what baffles me is why there would be support to make things worse.\nIt’s why I find Trump’s support for re-opening coal mines a bit nutty as policy when there is no real marketplace for coal, and the proven resulting pollution obviously makes what is already bad much worse.\nAs the Post editorial argued, “Swapping out all the old incandescent bulbs across the country would save an astonishing amount of energy, which would translate into big savings for consumers and less pollution over time. But Republicans stymied the Obama administration’s efforts to pursue this policy, which has no downside, and the Trump administration is now using its power over federal efficiency standards to extend the rollback.”\nIt was in 2007 that Congress mandated a shift toward the LED light bulb. As manufacturers invested in manufacturing lights that use these updated technologies, the prices dropped, the bulbs improved and consumers saw lower energy bills for doing very little.\nBy 2020, all bulbs were supposed to be LEDs, including bulbs for candelabras, recessed lighting, heavy-duty applications and others also be subject added in the latter days of the Obama era. The Trump administration moved last week to eliminate those addition, despite the fact that the 2020 standards would have saved consumers billions of dollars per year and 140 billion kilowatt-hours in energy waste—the equivalent to the output of 45 coal-fired power plants—in 2025, according to the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which advocates stiffer efficiency programs. Exempting candelabra and other lights from the 2020 standard could cut roughly in half the number of bulbs that would be required to use better technology, research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests. The Appliance Standards Awareness Project estimates that the Trump rollback will cost consumers an additional $12 billion per year in 2025.\nThe editorial noted that the Trump administration has signaled that it would attempt to roll back the 2020 standards further in coming months.\nThe editorial concluded, “There is no excuse for unnecessary energy waste and every reason for the federal government to coordinate a move toward better bulbs. The Trump administration should halt its know-nothing rollback.”\nIn my environmental balance, we should be seeking out painless, passive ways to make things a bit better. As I am reminded about eating towards better health, we need not go on starvation diets, we just need to pay better attention to everyday habits.\nThe habit in this administration seems to be doing the opposite.",

         "One need not be an expert in negotiations to understand the basic elements of a deal. At its core, one side tells another, “I’ll give you x, if you give me y.” If the parties agree to the terms, an agreement is reached, and the transaction goes forward.\nIn the dominant political fight in D.C., Donald Trump wants a giant wall along the U.S./Mexico border. In order to reach his goal, the Republican president is prepared to offer congressional Democrats … nothing. The purported author of the ghost-written “Art of the Deal” – a man who routinely pretends to be a world-class authority on negotiations – is trying to reach an agreement in which his White House makes no concessions.\nTrump simply wants Democratic lawmakers to give him more than $5 billion for a vanity project – as if he’s entitled to it. The wall should be a reward for how awesome the president’s awesomeness is. For some reason, this hasn’t worked.\nOf course, Trump could try a more conventional approach to negotiating, in which he offered something tangible that Democrats want in exchange for what he wants. In fact, some on the right are concerned the president may eventually do exactly that. The New York Times published a quote the other day that stood out for me:\n“I’ve always thought it created a danger that he would trade almost anything in order to get the wall – I think that’s still a potential danger,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that argues for less immigration. “I’m still worried about that now.”\nFrom a conservative perspective, those concerns are well grounded. Democrats really don’t want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a giant, ineffective border wall, so if Trump were try to come up with an offer designed to entice them, he’d have to propose something that would be (a) enormous; and (b) wildly unpopular among Republicans.\nAnd this got me thinking: what exactly would it take? What would a borderline-desperate president put on the table to sway Democrats?\nAs of yesterday, the White House’s position was plainly absurd: if Democrats agreed to finance a border wall, Trump would end the shutdown. Since the government has to re-open anyway, and that’s a priority for both parties, it obviously can’t be the basis for a credible deal.\nSimilarly, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) suggested the president offer a debt-ceiling increase and higher domestic spending caps. Of course, raising the debt limit falls into the same category as re-opening government – it’s a bipartisan priority that has to happen – though higher domestic spending caps is at least a step in the right direction.\nI’ve seen some talk about offering DACA protections to Dreamers in exchange for a wall, but Trump has already rejected this offer in the recent past, and besides, at least for now, those DACA protections already exist.\nIt’s why Republicans will have to think much bigger. What if Trump offered some combination of a universal background check system on gun purchases, dramatically expanded voting rights, and new health care protections? Would Dems be tempted to write a check for the border?\nI don’t know. Maybe the president should try it and see what happens.",

         "YouTube says no ‘deepfakes’ or ‘birther’ videos with toughened 2020 election stance\nYouTube is making clear there will be no “birtherism” on its platform during this year’s U.S. presidential election – a belated response to a type of conspiracy theory more prevalent in the 2012 race.\nThe Google-owned video service is also reiterating that it won’t allow election-related “deepfake” videos and anything that aims to mislead viewers about voting procedures and how to participate in the 2020 census.\nYouTube clarified its rules ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday. The company is mostly reiterating content guidelines that it has been putting in place since the last presidential election in 2016.\nIts ban on technically manipulated videos of political figures was made apparent last year when YouTube became the first major platform to remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. But the announcement Monday further clarifies that it will take down any election-related videos that are technically altered to mislead people in a way that goes beyond simply taking clips of speech out of context. The company also said it would remove doctored videos that could cause “serious risk of egregious harm” – such as to make it appear that a government official is dead.\n'Hey Google, show me photos': Google presents emotional 'Loretta' Super Bowl commercial\nFacebook: Sheryl Sandberg updates her relationship status with engagement announcement\nFacebook, which last year had resisted early calls to yank the Pelosi video, said in January that it was banning “deepfake” videos, the false but realistic clips created with artificial intelligence and sophisticated tools. Such videos are still fairly rare compared to simpler “cheap fake” manipulations such as were used in the video that altered Pelosi’s speech to make it seem like she was slurring her words.\nGoogle also said Monday that it will remove any videos that advance false claims about whether political candidates and elected officials are eligible to serve in office. That had been policy before, but wasn’t made explicit.\nThe company’s announcement comes about nine years after celebrity businessman Donald Trump began to get notice for claiming that Barack Obama, the nation’s first African American president, was not born in the United States.\nTrump repeatedly voiced citizenship doubts even after Obama produced his long-form birth certificate. Trump only fully backed off from the idea in the final stages of his 2016 presidential campaign.\nYouTube said it will also crack down on any attempts to artificially increase the number of views, likes and comments on videos. It changed its systems for recommending what videos users watch last year in a push to curb harmful misinformation. Twitter and Pinterest also last week outlined their efforts to reduce election misinformation on their platforms.\nMisinformation: Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter scramble to contain cororavirus misinformation\nDeepfakes: How to spot them on Facebook and YouTube ahead of the presidential election",

         "Speaking to the country for the first time from the Oval Office Tuesday night, President Donald Trump doubled down on his demands for a border wall in a brief speech amid his self-induced government shutdown\nDemocrats remain completely opposed to the president’s proposal for a wall and arranged to respond to Trump’s remarks shortly after he made them. Ahead of the speech, there was widespread debate about the TV network’s decision to broadcast the speech at all, given Trump’s propensity to lie and mislead about this subject in particular.\nHere are five of the lies or misleading statements he made in the address:\n1. Trump claimed there is a “security” crisis on the border.\nWhile there has been an increase in children and families crossing the border seeking asylum in recent months, the rate of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border is actually much lower than it has been in recent history, as Vox’s Dara Lind explained. The Trump administration’s claims that there is some sort of terrorism risk from the border have been debunked. So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis.\n2. Trump said illegal immigration drives down wages.\nOne of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers. While some economists argue this to be the case for some lower-income workers, many others disagree. But even if it’s true, the impact of immigrants on wages is marginal, and it could be completely wiped out by pro-labor policies that Trump and other Republicans oppose, like raising the minimum wage and protecting unions.\n3. Trump lied and said that the Democrats requested a “steel barrier.”\nDemocrats have not requested a steel barrier. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that she wants to spend exactly $0 on the wall — no matter what it’s made out of.\n4. Trump said the border wall will pay for itself.\nTrump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself. There’s no reason to believe this is the case — especially when it’s considered that the government will not only have to pay for the construction of the wall, but for any land seized to build the wall through eminent domain.\n5. Trump said the new version of NAFTA will also pay for the wall.\nThe new version of NAFTA, which Trump calls USMCA, has some minor modifications from the original version. However, there’s no plausible argument that it will somehow pay for the wall. And even if it did, it hasn’t even been passed by Congress yet.",

         "The left has a thing for taking babies hostage. A perfect example of the “give us socialism or we’ll kill the kids” genre was recently published in The Guardian titled “The hardest decision of my life: to end a pregnancy because I had no paid leave.”\nThis sort of story is irresistible to left-wing Christians such as Elizabeth Bruenig of The New York Times, whose tweet about the article is now deleted. It allows them to declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state.\nThis argument salves their consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. It is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born.\nThe Guardian article was designed to illustrate that argument, but on examination it demonstrates its failure. The author knew the child in her womb was a unique human life (“Looking at our wedding photos, I realized there were not just two lives present but three”), yet she chose an abortion anyway.\nHer ostensible reason is that, having just begun her job, she was not yet eligible for its paid leave policy, although management might have made an exception if she had asked (she thought about asking, but didn’t). She would certainly have been able to use sick days, if she had them, or ask for an unpaid leave of absence. This means she aborted her child because she was at risk of losing a few weeks’ pay.\nThe author does not provide details, but it is revealing that she described her decision in terms of anxiety and planning preferences—“Was having the baby with extremely limited funds, in a small apartment, actually a romantic way to start a family?”—rather than directly stating that having the baby would be financially ruinous. She concludes her self-justification by declaring that “our situation did not embody the climate of confidence we agreed was necessary for us to be parents.”\nThis shift from paid leave to a general “climate of confidence” gives the game away. If this was just about a few weeks of pay, it raises the question of whether there was some way for the author to raise that money in lieu of having her child killed. Notably, she does not report asking anyone for help. Her initial framing forces her to put a dollar amount on the life of her child, and confronts whether she could have done anything to ransom her baby. In contrast, demanding a “climate of confidence” makes her subjective sense of things a justification for what she did, regardless of the actual details of her case.\nThis is not to say that her situation was not sympathetic. Having a baby is hard. Caring for a baby is hard. Going back to work after a few weeks, or even a few months, of leave is hard, made harder still if that leave has been at least partly unpaid. But a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for.\nI am open to arguments that the United States should have more substantial pro-natalist policies, and conservatives have been promoting and debating various proposals that would add to existing policies such as the child tax credit and, yes, paid family leave, which President Trump promoted in his latest State of the Union address. But the left wants more than generous family leave policies, and will still champion abortion even if it gets its entire wish list.\nLooking around the world, there is never enough socialism for socialists to agree to abolish abortion. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to agree to end abortion—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates. Even if the left gets everything else it wants, it will still insist on a right to kill developing humans in utero.\nIn contrast, I and many others would happily compromise to end the legal killing of developing human persons in utero. Tax us more, cut the military, regulate businesses more, and expand the welfare state—we could tolerate America becoming more like 1970s Scandinavia if it meant that the left would agree let the babies live. But the left won’t, and the Guardian article shows why.\nBearing and raising children requires sacrifices even in the most generous of welfare states. Rather than make those sacrifices, this mother sacrificed her child, and the left will defend her absolute right to do so even in their socialist utopia. Their vision of liberation from material necessity includes liberation not only from poverty, but also from the consequences of our sexual embodiment. Hence the unwavering socialist support for unrestricted legal abortion.\nOf course, many people refuse to admit the monstrous reality of the abortion regime that they and their political leaders support. Hence the pretense that some invisible hand of socialist plenty will end abortion, and the efforts to deflect blame for our nation’s abortion culture onto those who are working to abolish it. But it is just not so.\nIt was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. She didn’t get an abortion because it was impossible for her to afford her baby; she got an abortion because she didn’t want her baby.",

         "In Barack Obama’s first term, the administration came to a fairly obvious conclusion: to address the climate crisis, we’re going to need to reduce emissions, and in the United States, the #1 source of carbon pollution is transportation. With that in mind, the Democratic White House created tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, to be phased in gradually.\nManufacturers, not surprisingly, weren’t thrilled, but there was a broad realization that the policy, in conjunction with a series of related efforts, would make a positive difference.\nThen Donald Trump got elected. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more.\nBy way of a defense, the Trump administration said the new policy would improve auto safety – which as we discussed at the time, makes about as much sense as it sounds.\nNevertheless, the Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway. But the New York Times reports today on an unexpected twist: auto manufacturers believe the White House’s anti-climate plans have gone too far.\nThe world’s largest automakers warned President Trump on Thursday that one of his most sweeping deregulatory efforts – his plan to weaken tailpipe pollution standards – threatens to cut their profits and produce “untenable” instability in a crucial manufacturing sector. In a letter signed by 17 companies including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Volvo, the automakers asked Mr. Trump to go back to the negotiating table on the planned rollback of one of President Barack Obama’s signature policies to fight climate change.\nThe problem for the industry has become a practical one: Trump intends to go so far in gutting pollution safeguards that many states intend to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own.\nThat includes, naturally, California – home to the nation’s largest consumer base.\nThe result is an exceedingly messy economic dynamic, in which car manufacturers in the United States – which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era policy – will have to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country.\nNot surprisingly, no one sees that as a sustainable business model.\nThe industry seems to realize this is a mess it helped create: companies wanted Trump to roll back Obama-era standards, so he did. What manufacturers didn’t realize is (a) how far the Republican would go; and (b) what would happen if they got what they wanted.\nComplicating matters, of course, there’s a decent chance a Democrat will win the presidency next year, at which point he or she will likely abandon Trump’s pro-pollution posture and go back to the auto industry with some thoughts about even more stringent emissions rules.\nThe industry wants the White House to negotiate some kind of deal with California, with the intention of creating a national standard that everyone can live with. That seems unlikely: Team Trump broke off talks with the Golden State months ago, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has rejected the idea of halfway measures.\nWatch this space.",

         "Republicans should stop fighting amnesty, President Obama said on Thursday, because one day a Hispanic will become president.\n“Over the long term, this is going to get solved, because at some point there’s going to be a President Rodriguez or there’s going to be a President Chen,” Obama told a Florida International University town hall audience, hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC.\n“The country is a nation of immigrants, and ultimately it will reflect who we are and its politics are going to reflect who we are,” Obama continued, implying that neither native-born Americans or legal immigrants have moral standing to determine who enters and stays in the country.\nHispanic foreigners attending the town hall — Fox News Latino did not say whether they were legal or illegal aliens — told Obama they feared that federal Judge Andrew Hansen’s stay on Obama’s executive order will force them to return to their home countries. (Fox News Latino incorrectly identifies Hansen as a Texas judge.)\nThe five million illegal aliens covered by Obama’s executive order could also cash in on as much as $35,000 in taxpayer handouts. That’s a minimum $175 million cost to American taxpayers for the first year alone, not counting the massive strain the low-income, poorly-educated, gang-prone aliens with high rates of illegitimacy and untreated diseases will place on the country’s medical and social institutions.\nObama’s claim that “history” was on his side is arguably false. The massive, historically unprecedented wave of immigrants crashing across the U.S. southern border is a political phenomenon, set in motion by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and accelerated by the Obama administration’s disastrous Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).\nThe explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years.\nEach year, four million Americans seeking jobs turn 18. In 2012, almost six million Americans graduated from college, saddled with an average $27,000 in student loan debt — $8,000 less than the handouts available for illegals presently in the country.\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.",

       "'YouTube is making clear there will be no “birtherism” on its platform during this year’s U.S. presidential election – a belated response to a type of conspiracy theory more prevalent in the 2012 race. So while there may be a humanitarian crisis driving more vulnerable people to seek asylum in the United States, there is no security crisis. Looking around the United States, there is never enough welfare for the left to stop killing developing humans in utero—solidly Democratic states lead the nation in abortion rates.  The Republican president assumed he was helping the industry at the expense of the environment – a trade-off Trump was happy to make since he rejects climate science anyway.  The explosion of the Hispanic population has long-term job prospect consequences as well: Both legal and illegal aliens will occupy 75 percent of new American jobs in as little as five years. The anti-vaccine movement made headlines last spring, when widespread distrust of the pharmaceutical industry and the belief that vaccines can lead to autism in children led to a measles outbreak.  Voting in quasi-militarized settings was not confined to the nation’s capital. In Philadelphia, on election eve, the mayor announced a curfew that was slated to take effect an hour before its polls closed, but subsequently delayed it after an outcry by other city officials and activists.  But one glaring absentee was Trump, who not only declined an invitation but failed to send any American representative at all. Track and field athletes don’t typically earn the lucrative salaries seen in the NBA, NFL, tennis or international soccer. In other words, the agency responsible for protecting consumers now wants to make it easier for them to get stuck in a cycle of debt they can never repay. A Catholic priest in Rhode Island who barred state lawmakers who supported an abortion rights bill from receiving communion at his church has doubled down on his stance, saying abortion is worse than pedophilia. Gwyneth Paltrow’s anti-vaxxer ally comes under fire for ‘discredited pseudo-scientific claims’ about coronavirus Gadsby\\'s work is a testament to how eagerly the arbiters of our culture will devour and elevate work that convincingly purports to be progressive. That’s led some vaccine foes to join the protesters — whom Trump has encouraged on Twitter — in staging demonstrations in state capitals to “reopen America.” That’s why white nationalists, who are enthusiasts for the abortion of black and brown people, despise pro-lifers, as anyone reporting in good faith should know. Biden was particularly critical of Trump’s visit on Monday to a historic church across from the White House, which was preceded by law enforcement authorities dispersing a crowd near the church with smoke canisters and flash grenades. Young women taking part in high school and college athletics across the country have had their dreams of winning dashed by the movement to allow biological male who “identify” as female to compete against them. Under current immigration policies, it’s possible that immigration arrests could lead to poor mental health by increasing deportation fears among undocumented individuals and their families and neighbors, the study authors write. Less-organized migrants, tighter immigration control by Guatemalan authorities and the presence of U.S. advisers have reduced the likelihood that the hundreds of migrants who departed Honduras will form anything like the cohesive procession the term “caravan” now conjures. Trump enjoys and encourages state brutality against people of color, and black people in particular. It excites him and his most ardent followers. But his response isn’t just based on personal predilections. It’s also based on political considerations. Abortionists, who prey on desperate people, should no longer receive your hard-earned tax dollars. The Trump administration has continued to deny climate change findings and make scientific reports inaccessible to the public. In the months that followed, all independent polling has found the American mainstream not only blames Trump and his party for the shutdown, but also does not want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on an ineffective and unnecessary border wall. Kendrick, who, like many Planned Parenthood supporters, blames men for pro-life legislation while she ignores mention of the life of unborn babies, also drafted a “testicular bill of rights. UFC Middleweight Champion Israel Adesanya’s comment that his opponent will \"crumble like the Twin Towers\", in addition to being terrible and inappropriate, also makes no sense.  Yet when researchers in the U.S. have been so corrupt they have gone to jail, mainstream scientists still accept their research. Donald Trump has taken heat for mostly refusing to mask up while performing his duties. This left the Biden camp with a choice to make when Joe woke up from political hibernation, and they went all in. Omar believes USA Powerlifting is discriminating against males who identify as transgender women, based on the “myth” that they have a “direct competitive advantage” over biological females. Christians should make clear that the perpetuation of objectionable vaccines and the lack of alternatives is a kind of coercion. Democrats really don’t want to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a giant, ineffective border wall, so if Trump were try to come up with an offer designed to entice them, he’d have to propose something that would be (a) enormous; and (b) wildly unpopular among Republicans. Before we get to work dispensing these arguments, it’s important to acknowledge that they are, on some level, understandable. A lot of Americans, especially those who got their bachelor’s degree before the early 2000s, find it baffling that younger generations can’t work their way through college. In July 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other Democrats visited a similar processing center in Clint, Texas, and made explosive allegations about the conditions there. As Breitbart News most recently reported, blue-collar Americans in landscaping, conservation work, the meatpacking industry, construction industry, and fishing jobs have had their wages dragged down by foreign workers imported through the H-2B visa program. In August, Planned Parenthood made the decision to opt out of the federal family planning grant program, portraying itself as a victim of the Trump administration. State health departments and legislators who sneer at parental concerns and call for vaccination mandates erode parents’ trust. Cuban slave doctors that have escaped the system have said that, while working abroad, the Castro regime forced them to invent patients and throw away perfectly good medicine to boost the statistics on the number of patients Cuban doctors actually treat. British Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies also slammed the concept of transgender athletes. Biden’s appearance was a contrast with the approach of Republican President Donald Trump, who has made no major public statement to address the growing crisis but issued tweets as he remained out of sight in the White House. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) introduced two bills on Tuesday to target the “monopolies” higher education institutions have created to make earning degrees involve accumulating massive student debt. The Trump Administration hasn’t built a single foot of border fencing after thirty months of riling up its supporters with claims that the wall was vital to national security. As part of his plan to protect the commonwealth of Virginia from the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, Gov. Ralph Northam determined that citizens should not be allowed to attend church or worship services, but are fine travel to an abortion clinic and undergo an elective procedure like surgical abortion. Countless American believers in the Bible, myself included, were inspired tremendously on Monday when President Trump stood in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church, across the street from the White House, and held up the Word of God for all to see. To bolster the argument that doctors deliver viable infants alive and let them die, the anti-choice movement also trots out a series of people who claim to have “survived” abortion.  Shelby Steele, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution said Friday that the contemporary civil rights movement under the banner of “Black Lives Matter” was deeply unserious, catering to an old form of victimization that has accomplished nothing to lift up black people. Vaccine critics, for example, have long championed the false claim that vaccines cause autism, and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tried to cover up that information, Gorski said.  Having a baby is hard, caring for a baby is hard, going back to work after a leave is hard but a few weeks of salary is not worth killing your baby for. After that phone call, police asked the couple to come in for questioning, prompting them to flee Saudi Arabia, a country long known for draconian laws against homosexuality. Drivers in Ireland will be forced to buy electric vehicles within ten years according to a new law by the left-wing government in Dublin. Lots of politicians and critics across the board have attacked the Green New Deal proposed last week by freshman Democrats Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. In the dominant political fight in D.C., Donald Trump wants a giant wall along the U.S./Mexico border. While President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial had been wrapping up, he expanded one of his most controversial and inflammatory policies with little fanfare and minimal opposition: the travel ban on people from multiple Muslim-majority countries. And most egregiously, in what will surely be viewed as one of the most ill-advised stunts in presidential history, the Trump Administration had federal security forces use tear gas and projectiles to vacate Lafayette square by force of arms so Trump could make a show of walking over to St. John’s Church and posing awkwardly with a bible held upside down. Franciscan friar Father Daniel Horan, a pro-LGBT priest and professor who will be speaking at the upcoming Los Angeles Religious Education Congress, took to Twitter this weekend to bash the March for Life and condemn without trial a group of white Catholic high school boys as “racists” for supposedly “taunting” a Native American man beating a drum. Given these bleak prospects, students who go to college to “find themselves” are likely to waste precious time and money because they lack a clear vision.  People keep getting sick and the economy is cratering, but for Republicans, hating women is still a major priority: republican governors in Texas, Ohio and even Maryland are trying to use the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to block women from getting abortions, claiming that ending a pregnancy is a “nonessential” medical procedure that must be rescheduled. The Times’ about-face was just one example of a little Orwellian campaign that’s sprung up in the liberal media since the Disneyland measles outbreak to try to rewrite history by shoehorning vaccine opposition into the shopworn trope that it is conservatives who are “anti-science.” It wasn\\'t long after Donald Trump and his team took office that they looked for ways to make things easier for polluters. We should expect growing support for this item for a few reasons: Younger voters of all political stripes are being exposed to the status quo student loan system. Younger voters are also less likely to accept the toxic brand of “conservatism.”  President Donald Trump bragged on Sunday that the Republican Party has never been stronger or more united than it is now, even as his impeachment trial is set to begin in the Senate this week.  If sports don’t trump religion as the opiate of the masses, they have, until recently, been at least the background music of most of our lives. No amount of denial from pro-choicers can change the fact that many post-abortive mothers carry the grief of a severed parent-child bond with them. A federal judge in Tucson, Arizona delivered a blow Monday to the Trump administration’s strategy of criminalizing humanitarian aid work along the southern border with her decision to overturn the convictions of four volunteers on religious freedom grounds. Former ESPN personality Jemele Hill attacked the NFL for its lack of black coaches, and blasted the Rooney Rule as an insufficient solution to the problem. A leader of a movement that urges women to brag about having an abortion promoted the procedure to children in a video from Cut’s HiHo on the YouTube channel. In fact, the scenario of killing babies after they\\'re born that Trump depicted was ridiculously false. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a staunch anti-immigrant populist, said on Wednesday a new wave of migrants trying to cross the border from Turkey into the European Union must be stopped as far south as possible and his government was ready to help frontline Greece. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Monday waxed hyperbolic about the 2020 presidential election, telling an audience that “civilization as we know it is at stake.” Obama’s joke about moat with alligators came to mind while reading a newly published report from the New York Times on Donald Trump’s zealotry on border policy. The over-the-top, theatrical lies of the anti-choice movement are so comical that the mainstream media, for decades, has shied away from covering them too closely, likely out of fear that they’re actually too ridiculous to be believed. However, China’s record of successfully producing vaccines in recent years has been so abysmal that communist state media openly admit that they prefer using international manufacturers. Lawmakers who claim to care about women’s emotional health would do better to listen to the hundreds of thousands of women who seek abortion care every year and know it is the right decision. John Oliver admits he\\'s scared of \"literally everything,\" but perhaps nothing more than parents-turned-activists seemingly hellbent on unleasing a new plague. By any sensible measure, the Trump administration is among the worst ever seen for respecting, valuing, and following science. The travel ban would not have prevented the country’s deadliest terrorist attacks in recent years, which were committed by right-wing Americans, not immigrants: the anti-immigrant extremist who killed 22 shoppers at a store in El Paso; the white supremacist who killed 17 students and teachers at a school in Parkland, Florida; or the anti-Semite who killed 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh. While these many similarities between Green New Deal and the constitution ushered in by Venezuelan leftist dictator Hugo Chavez in 1999 may be just happenstance, the important thing to remember is that Venezuela under its new constitution has become a disaster zone. The government wants to usurp parents, any chance they get. What consequences does this have in the lives of American families? Pelosi’s coronavirus plan uses the pandemic to cram provisions of the House Democrats’ H.R. 1 legislation into federal law. That legislation went even further in its efforts to create loopholes for voter fraud, allowing convicted felons to vote in federal elections. That’s because while these problems have been centuries in the making from slavery to Jim Crow to Ferguson and beyond, Donald Trump’s particular failings as a person and a candidate are fanning the flames of the crisis. In certain ways, 2020 feels a lot like 1968. Federal troops and local police are clashing with Black people sick of police brutality and discrimination. Americans are dying in massive, alarming numbers ― then, in the Vietnam war; now, as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the nation. Americans are angry. This is also true for students snookered into matriculating at sketchy for-profit colleges, which offer almost no marketable skills or career preparedness to justify the cost. And it further describes recent college graduates who, through an accident of timing, entered the real world during the Great Recession and its aftermath, finding it difficult to obtain work in their field of study. Despite saving millions upon millions of lives, vaccines have been meet with skepticism by a small but growing faction of conspiracy theorists. And Donald Trump, \"human megaphone that is the president of the United States,\" has only made matters worse by supporting an \"alternative vaccine schedule.\" Proponents of stricter protections for students argue the DOE’s recent rollback of Obama-era rules aimed at protecting students from predatory for-profit colleges will only lead to even more student failing to pay back their loans. Greenpeace co-founder and former president of Greenpeace Canada Patrick Moore explained to Breitbart News how Greenpeace’s original spirit of celebrating humanity was usurped by an anti-human Malthusian vision. Amid pressure from Washington, Mexico is backpedaling on promises of better treatment for Central American migrants, leaving hundreds stranded in unsanitary camps near its southern border and allegations of irregular detentions. This is a positive for the party’s electoral prospects, after a bitterly fragmented primary. Unfortunately, the people selected for the task forces demonstrate how not only the party establishment, but even an insurgent progressive like Sanders, privilege certain topics over others. The criminal justice reform task force is incredibly milquetoast. After years of openly struggling with her weight (and health) and a seemingly self-imposed sabbatical from political lectures after backing Hillary Clinton in ’16, actress Lena Dunham announced to the world that it was Joaquin Phoenix’s unhinged Oscars tirade on the environment that has made her want to become vegan. Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and many of his administration’s policies have played on the trope of threats posed by refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants. A lawsuit percolating through the courts attempts to weigh the religious liberty of Orthodox Jews with a dire and compelling public health interest. As the world as we know it comes to a quicker-than-expected end, with much of Australia caught up in wildfires that climate change did not start, but are unquestionably making worse, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is getting roundly toasted for his announcement that the company with the too-ironic name will be donating roughly $690,000 to Australia to help combat the ongoing fires. One of soccer\\'s most infamous match-fixing cases was settled Thursday when a referee notorious for corrupt calls was banned for life. As part of Pelosi’s coronavirus plan, House Democrats slipped in multiple measures from their H.R. 1 legislation that would implement nationwide ballot harvesting for federal elections — effectively allowing political operatives to collect and deliver an endless number of absentee ballots from voters. One of the things that makes Alabama’s measure extraordinary is its radical simplicity: it simply bans all abortions, at every stage of pregnancy. High unemployment numbers among foreign-born nationals have been an issue that has plagued Sweden for years, with reports often showing the migrant unemployment rate as being several times higher than that of native Swedes. Rather than reducing federal subsidies to universities and placing the leftist institutions at the mercy of the free market, Obama wants to increase the amount students can borrow with interest from the government. Sure, some people might prioritize Netflix and pumpkin spice lattes over student loan payments and retirement contributions. But for people like David (not his real name), a 32-year-old living in Harlem, New York, banking fees eat up a good chunk of his income. Critics of the Trump administration’s immigration policies have said such policies violate migrants’ rights and further endanger them by making them wait in dangerous border towns or in one of the most violent countries in the world lacking robust asylum systems. Now, with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, and with states like New York and Virginia among others pushing boundaries on abortion to extremes, the Republicans in Congress is rolling out a long-term push to force the Democrats to hold a vote on the bill. Semenya, a two-time Olympic champion in the 800 meters, will now be forced to medicate to suppress her testosterone levels if she wants to defend her world title in September in Doha, Qatar. Despite the image portrayed of popular culture in the media, of those Millennials surveyed, only seven percent supported abortion without any exceptions and funded by taxpayer dollars — the position embraced by the Democrat Party. Biden’s five picks are typical of centrists who want to trim the edges of our bloated, draconian justice system without changing anything systemically. As shown below, women are harmed by Planned Parenthood, and the vulnerable––such as sex abuse victims and the unborn––are sacrificed for profit and political advance. Facebook, YouTube and Amazon all answered with policy changes, removing some fear-mongering content related to vaccines. The cost of college tuition is increasing at the same time the federal government is originating and managing 93 percent of all student loans and has launched a liberal student loan forgiveness program – all of which means the burden of increasing amounts of student debt has been taken up by taxpayers at the same time average college students are spending less time with their studies. An illegal alien has been charged with enticing a 13-year-old girl through social media and raping her in Madison County, Alabama. In October, Breitbart London reported that French police are allegedly actively assisting migrants to avoid detection by UK Border Force, telling them when and when not to attempt to cross the channel, according to a people smuggler. The New York State legislature has put in place one of the most radical abortion laws in the United States following a vote in both chambers on Tuesday. The law is meant to put forth the “fundamental right” to abortion and end protections from babies in the womb up to birth. Dem Senators Say Mismanaged Student Loan Program Screwed Thousands Football supports Trump in its promotion of racial division, the crushing of dissent, and the spread of misinformation, inequality, and brutality. Thus far in the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has flippantly downplayed the threat from China, only to quickly walk back his comments when he faced backlash. Even though Thunberg is capable of doing things many on the right refuse to do — such as read and understand scientific evidence — right-wingers argued that Thunberg and her fellow youth activists cannot think for themselves. Threre are some concerns about whether some of the goals set by the Green New Deal are realistic, but to argue that the blueprint is genocidal is hopelessly bonkers. Powell and others in the George W. Bush administration lied extensively while making the case for war in Iraq in the early 2000s, fabricating “evidence” of the existence of weapons of mass destruction within the country. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump will give an Oval Office address on the government shutdown he created, during which he presumably will lie through his teeth to defend his highly unpopular immigration agenda. Anti-vaxxers represent only about 2 percent of American families, although you’d be forgiven for thinking they’re more numerous. They certainly make a lot of noise and have some world-famous adherents. However, like malaria-carrying mosquitoes, this tiny group that punches above its weight may be on the verge of creating a public health problem for us all. Matters worsened for him when COVID-19 hit the United States and exposed him not just as a divisive buffoon, but a cynically incompetent one. The Administration delayed its response, worried that any action they took would hurt the stock market and erode Trump’s last remaining electoral strength. Tellingly, when not constrained by the debate format, these same politicians push the same narrative to garner support for bailing out student loans, all while the media provides the Democrats a free assist. A family-run network of pro-gun groups is behind five of the largest Facebook groups dedicated to protesting the shelter-in-place restrictions, according to an NBC News analysis of Facebook groups and website registration information. Now that most of America has begun opening back up without the predicted spikes in coronavirus and Joe Biden has left his basement bunker, Americans are remembering that there’s an election going on. As normalcy quickly returns some places, so to has the battle for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Medically unnecessary laws regulating abortion have been exposed as dishonest attempts to close clinics. But last Wednesday, when the Heritage Clinic for Women in Grand Rapids, Michigan, opened in the morning, the staff were startled to find 25 to 30 protesters assembling, many of them holding single red roses. Ignoring the no-trespassing signs, they began swarming the clinic’s parking lot, rushing patients as they got out of their cars. The spectacular rise of human civilization that took place during the last 10,000 years now appears to be coming to an end with the refusal of our species to significantly curb the carbon emissions and pollutants that might cause human extinction. The law is one of the most restrictive in the United States and activists say it effectively forbids most abortions since many women do not know they are pregnant yet at eight weeks. Obama’s claim that “history” was on his side is arguably false. The massive, historically unprecedented wave of immigrants crashing across the U.S. southern border is a political phenomenon, set in motion by the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act and accelerated by the Obama administration’s disastrous Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Such rivals as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw overstepping in the name of climate change, a blown campaign rollout to even explain all of its aspirational aspects, and, more generally, a need to slap down an unruly first-year Democratic Socialist. Oh for crying out loud. The desperation. Imagine if you got your news only from the New York Times, and how bigoted that would make you against non-liberals. Thousands of asylum seekers crammed in border towns near the Texas-Mexico border awaiting U.S. immigration hearings are at risk of dying from coronavirus because of poor health access and unsafe conditions, advocates say. Naturally, of course, right-wingers reacted in the ugliest way possible: By arguing that Thunberg’s identity — as a young person, as a person on the autism spectrum and, although they are careful not to say this directly, as a girl — inherently discredits what she has to say. USA Today Sports published a broadside against youth tackle football, claiming that the sport is just too dangerous for children. The anti-vaccine crowd frequently falls back on the claim that vaccines cause autism, despite more than two dozen studies clearly showing that vaccination does not increase the incidence of autism. Nor did it make a whit of biological sense that vaccines would.  Gautney consented to this field, job, and city, so if she has an issue with compensation or cost of living, switching to a more lucrative field or cheaper place to live is a decision she should make for herself, not a decision that ought to be bailed out by unsuspecting taxpayers who played no role in the choice.  For about five years, between 2006 and 2011, HuffPo was a hotbed bed of anti-vaccine conspiracy theorizing. U.S. Rep. Steve King, under fire for defending white nationalism and white supremacism is now endorsing President Trump’s desire to declare a national emergency to build his wall. The case made by Geoffrey Skelley and Nathaniel Rakich was simple: Supposedly Americans strongly prefer Biden and Democrats over Trump and Republicans, and they are particularly upset with Trump and other Republicans’ attempts to reopen the country as the global Coronavirus pandemic rages. A federal visa program allowing international students to work at firms in the United States after graduation appears to have been exploited by fake companies providing false employment verifications, according to an NBC News/NBC Bay Area investigation. While health experts say a vaccine to prevent infection is needed to return life to normal, the survey points to a potential trust issue for the Trump administration already under fire for its often contradictory safety guidance during the pandemic. The administration has stonewalled Congress during the impeachment proceedings and other investigations, but the American public overwhelmingly wants the Trump administration to comply with lawmakers. In his failed bid for the Democrat nomination for 2020, Beto O’Rourke said churches that oppose same-sex marriage should lose their tax-exempt status.  In other words, toe the non-Biblical party line or else! Michael Mann, arguably the world’s no. 1 climate alarmist, goes on to make proclamations that only a publication as ideologically compromised as the Guardian would think to publish. It’s also why attempts to portray pro-lifers as racists smack of disingenuousness. The Brazilian superstar’s career is a testament to what’s possible in women’s soccer — and also a reminder of how little attention the sport still receives. Last year, XFL Commissioner Oliver Luck noted that the XFL reached out to Kaepernick, but the former NFL player demanded absurdly high $20 million a season salary. Alarmingly, the Trump administration wants to take the reins off payday lenders. When the Muslim ban was first enacted, it triggered chaos at airports and prompted widespread protest and legal challenges, and it continues to impose devastating costs on families and people who wish to come to the U.S. This argument that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state is also an extension of the dishonest taunt that conservative Christians only care about babies before they’re born. President Trump is culpable in the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of Americans due to the evisceration of environmental protections in addition to the preventable deaths of tens of thousands of other Americans due to Trump’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic. But in an age when anti-vaccine conspiracy theories travel far and wide online and many parents are afraid of taking their pediatrician’s advice, Kentucky’s loose vaccination laws directly incentivize parents to follow Bevin’s lead. Curiously, both Kelly and Yen seem unaware of the influx of undocumented immigrants pouring into this country daily from countries with very low vaccination rates... It’s no\\xa0exaggeration to say that the anti-choice movement, from tip to toe, is stuffed with melodramatic liars and grifters. They will not do that by making the Department of Justice even less accountable to elected officials, as Democrats are demanding. They will do it by slashing and burning the bureaucracy and its powers. Government by and for the people will perish from the earth if unelected officials are capable of weaponizing government against the people’s elected representatives. Like the costly and controversial Green New Deal, which Booker co-sponsored in the form of a Senate resolution, Booker’s plan aims to address both climate change and economic inequality.  Trade jobs such as electricians or carpenters are in demand and provide steady salaries. Policymakers shouldn’t deter students who know a good job when they see it. Since 2016, Democrats have thrown sand, wrenches, and donkey poo into every gear of government to overturn the results of a free and fair election played by rules. Anyone who has shouldered the burden of six-figure student loan debt knows the heavy toll it can take.  One of the most common canards against immigration is the idea that illegal immigrants drive down the wages for native workers. Trying to bar women from abortion is bad enough in regular times, but it seemed even more sadistic during a pandemic and an economic crash, when financial and health concerns weigh more heavily than ever on women deciding whether or not continue pregnancies. The truth is that, in the face of a challenge as immense as climate change, government action is necessary if we want to ensure that our planet remains livable for future generations. Activists planning to line California roadways with anti-vaccination billboards full of misinformation are paying for them through Facebook fundraisers, despite a platform-wide crackdown on such campaigns. Here are three obvious but important ways the media demonstrated a disgusting partisan slant instead of good journalism. A shocking new study says that the ice in the Arctic Ocean will disappear by 2050, which could have \"substantial\" implications on the ecosystem and the climate in the region. She’s among four dozen or so people gathered outside on a hot late-summer morning, joining a hard core of activists who believe that all vaccines are dangerous and who have become increasingly emboldened about denouncing the medical establishment. Bevin’s downplaying of the necessity of vaccines is reckless — but deliberately infecting his children is much more so. Letters from GOP members of Congress and national pro-life leaders to the White House and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week asserted Democrats are attempting to exploit the coronavirus pandemic for the purpose of advancing their party’s pro-abortion agenda. Amanda Kifferly, vice president of abortion access for The Women’s Centers, explained that she’s seeing some of the ways that the coronavirus is making it harder for women to get an abortion, which was already difficult because of all the needless bureaucratic obstacles put in place by conservative legislators. The Guardian, insisting that the climate emergency is “the defining issue of our times,” has amped up its climate agitation by suggesting that Australian wildfires is the new normal.\\n It obviously works extremely well for Democrats, a large faction and the leadership of which appears to be as impervious to facts as anti-vaxxers and QAnon followers. Left-wing Christians declare that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary, and the only way to do that is by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state. The devil is in the details, however, since—while some charter schools are effective in achieving student success—others have been examples of cronyism and corruption as a result of arrangements between politicians and private businesses. Student debt increased by a whopping 107 percent between 2009 and 2019. Americans now owe $1.6 trillion in education loans. Policy wonks and politicians respond by concocting flashy plans that hardly solve the debt crisis. By threatening the kids and their families with deportation, the administration’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was effectively delivering death sentences. Social media users were quick to point out the interactions and slammed McGuire for appearing to undermine Coyne Schofield’s hockey skills. Rather than help be a part of the solution, Trump is intentionally exacerbating the tensions–not only because he himself is a racist whose politics of authoritarian white grievance align with the same forces driving police violence itself, but because he is desperate and in grave political peril. In the weeks leading up to the District of Columbia’s primary election, a powerful interest group repeatedly hammered council candidate Janeese Lewis George with an attack that in the past has proved devastating: She was soft on crime and unsupportive of the D.C. police force. Not content to recede gracefully, or even to steer clear of various conspiracies on par with fluoride and gay frogs, Miss Havisham is still at it. This time, she’s got a righteous burn for President Trump, imagining how John F. Kennedy would have sounded had he written a letter to former Soviet leader Nikita Kruschev along the lines of Trump’s recent letter to Turkish President Recep Erdogan. Newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in his individual dissent urging the law to go into effect, tipped his hand, Litman continues — he will rely on “flimsy distinctions” and “ostensibly procedural obstacles” to make obtaining an abortion impossible in states that desire to do so. While President Trump visited the southern border Thursday, Democratic darling Beto O’Rourke visited the dentist — posting a bizarre video showing him getting a mouth-wide-open cleaning in order to highlight the story of his dental hygienist’s upbringing in El Paso. Almost all of this is gibberish; Trump still can’t speak coherently about California’s wildfires; and no officials in the Golden State ever conceded that he was “right” about the subject, because he wasn’t. Trump, who actually was his school’s team captain, has long claimed that he was the best athlete there, a boast rarely challenged because coaches and classmates tended to praise him once it became in their best interests to do so. In court and in public, the administration defended the extreme and disruptive measure being based on national security considerations, though it was clearly an instantiation of Trump’s bigoted campaign promise to end all Muslim immigration to the United States. President Donald Trump is losing support from his evangelical base as he lurches from one crisis into another. Numerous polls show that religious Americans, like most other Americans, disapprove of the president’s performance, and that could imperil his re-election chances. Australian Rugby Player Israel Folau and his anti-gay sentiments appear to have gone too far this time. Last year, some states tried to ban abortion after just six weeks into a pregnancy ― when many women don’t even know they’re pregnant yet. Considering that 1 in 4 women has an abortion during her lifetime, the effects of these restrictions could prove devastating. As the Republican Party is struggling to defend him in a moment of nationwide strife, President Donald Trump decided Thursday night to fuel divisions within GOP rather than make nice. It’s not taxpayers’ fault that someone spent a lot of money she doesn’t have without a clear vision for how that degree could improve her later financial prospects. But the fact that Trump cloaks this fact by stoking false fears about immigrant crime and delivering rage-filled rants about “illegal” immigration shows that this isn’t some genuine and reasoned policy view about the costs and benefits of new entrants to the labor force — it’s a reactionary stance built atop anti-immigrant bigotry. President Donald Trump used the occasion to again voice skepticism about climate change. The fear was well-deserved, since Trump has also made a number of dangerous comments about vaccines, linking immunizations to cases of autism and suggesting we need different vaccination schedules for small children… Republicans are more pessimistic about the country’s direction than at almost any other time during Donald Trump’s presidency, as a trio of crises – the coronavirus pandemic, an economic downturn and mass protests over police brutality – buffets his administration. Celebrity Pseudoscience: Here Are Nine Household Names Who’ve Pushed Bad Science on The Public  While conservatives may find comfort in the old saw that those who aren’t liberal at 20 have no heart, and those who aren’t conservative at 40 have no brain, the truth, as Levin knows, is that those who are statists at 20 usually end up statists at 40. And he’s not content to allow time to take its uncertain political toll.  For example, business leaders say the nation’s enormous population of immigrants has expanded the nation’s workforce, increased consumption, and driven up housing prices but that inflow has also shrunk the wages of less-educated Americans, the report said. Her proposal brings into sharp focus conservatives’ crusade to legislate control of women’s bodies through restrictive abortion bills and other measures that undermine reproductive rights. Athletes and fans are excited for Sowers\\' historic role at Super Bowl LIV and have remarked that her position is especially poignant given there have only been 13 out gay and bi players in the NFL\\'s 100-year history, according to OutSports. Americans crashed the Selective Service Agency’s website in early January because of a false rumor that signing up for federal student aid through FAFSA also meant signing up for the draft. Luckily, it turns out that 18-year-olds don’t have to go to boot camp when they apply for student loans. But they could be signing up for burdensome debt. It is hard to argue that the highest income countries should not reduce their meat and dairy. Trump also threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that would allow the president to send U.S. armed forces into states for the purpose of domestic law enforcement, if mayors and governors didn’t do more to curb the unrest. It’s no surprise that her focus on policy has catapulted Warren back into serious contention. Digging into policy solutions for overlooked problems and explaining it in digestible soundbites is what she has done since the publication of her first book, “As We Forgive Our Debtors,” an empirical study of bankruptcy that completely changed how academics viewed the issue. New York’s attorney general said on Friday she has settled a lawsuit against three companies accused of tricking struggling borrowers into paying more than $1,000 for student loan debt relief services that were available for free. Hillary’s letter is painful. It’s riddled with stilted speech and a weak attempt to use swear words like that other future has-been who at least can kind of skateboard and pretend to air drum. Whether or not you agreed with Trump’s approach, at least his fondness for cuss words is authentic, something Hilldog struggles with. As the world’s scientists and pharmaceutical companies seek a cure for the coronavirus, other anti-vaxxers are gearing up for a fight against any potential new vaccine. Though it was Major League Baseball that he mentioned — “We have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old” — the sport that truly matters to him is football, the only major mass entertainment (other than Trumpism) that endorses tribalism and toxic masculinity so flagrantly and keeps violence in vogue. The Democratic candidates predictably criticized the worst Trump administration immigration policies, such as families separated at the border and chronic uncertainty for undocumented people in the U.S., many of whom arrived decades ago as children. Due to global overpopulation, giving birth is the worst thing you can do to the planet, MacCormack sustains, while insisting that she is not advocating wiping out the existing population but rather letting it die off. The movement’s hysteric leader proceeded to hush the crowd so the mayor’s answer could be heard across the streets so they could vote him out next year if he bowed to their anarchic demands. So it appears McCabe is allowed to lie to federal investigators about corruption affecting the U.S. government, cover it up with more lies, and get off scot-free even though what he did is a crime, while Stone faces years in prison for lying about gossip that affected nothing of public importance. As people sip cafecito and eat croquetas at the landmark restaurant, the buzz here these days is what Cubans say is the alarming rise of Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose unabashed defense of late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has riled Cuban-Americans who view his comments as a personal attack. The Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee honed his inner troll while using everything from posters showing Aquaman and Star Wars characters to quotes from Austin Powers to paint the Green New Deal bill as \"ridiculous\" and something that would never pass in Congress and never work.  The movement to ban or limit the use of natural gas in commercial and residential buildings opens a new front in the fight against climate change that could affect everything from heating systems in skyscrapers to stoves in suburban homes. The anti-vaccination community holds to an unscientific conspiracy theory that childhood vaccinations are toxic and cause numerous illnesses and injuries, including autism, and spreads these beliefs through YouTube, Facebook and other online platforms. While the major baseball leagues won’t be affected much by tariffs on Chinese imports, everyone from Double A players down through the office softball team will be. But she couldn’t shake criticism that she was an outsider compared to Leger Fernandez, who has served as counsel to several Native American tribes in the northern New Mexico district and had the backing of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. This includes children that officials have stolen from their families, done so with full knowledge that family separation and detention cause long-term harm to children, and done so with the fact that for the first time in years, migrant kids have died under U.S. watch. Some of the liberal opposition is often grounded in the mistaken belief that Warren’s plan would do more to reduce the racial wealth gap than Warren’s. The opposite is true: full cancellation would reduce the racial wealth gap more than Warren’s plan would.  Pope Francis issued a severe indictment Wednesday of humanity’s failure to care for the planet, as environmentalists commemorate the 50th anniversary of “Earth Day.” Here’s an irony: Thanks to Roe, America is a whiter place than it would otherwise have become. If pro-lifers had had their way, on the other hand, America would be considerably blacker and browner than it is today. In an article posted by NBC News on Monday, the AP argues that even erstwhile allies, like tennis great and gay activist Martina Navratilova, can become resentful of transgender women dominating their sport. A report by the United Nations (UN) falsely blamed President Trump for the detention of 100,000 migrant children who, in fact, were held in federal immigration custody in 2015 by President Obama. Hotez said anti-vaccine groups are seizing on the anti-government sentiment stoked by conservative-leaning protesters to advance their cause. House Republicans are gearing up for a sustained push to expose leftist Democrats in the House Democrat majority on their increasingly extreme views on abortion. If task force candidates from these organizations were absolute non-starters for presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, because they want to treat people who have committed crimes with too much human dignity, Sanders could instead have turned to an array of “progressive prosecutors.” Bennett is seen immediately unleashing a tirade against Pan as he walks beside the politician, who tries to ignore, then laugh off his antagonist. The Trump administration gave the Border Patrol unchallengeable authority over migrants seeking asylum by invoking a little-known power given to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. public health agency, to ban the entry of people or things that might spread “infectious disease” in the U.S. CNN national correspondent John King ripped President Donald Trump for not mentioning climate change in his second State of the Union address. The false messages that they say convinced hundreds of New Yorkers not to vaccinate their children weren’t spread in a Facebook group or on YouTube, but through a glossy magazine written by and for Orthodox Jewish parents. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee moved forward with plans for an expansive investigation into Trump World abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release a rather intemperate press statement. President Donald Trump in an interview on Wednesday ripped former Vice President Joe Biden for failing on race relations, after 43 years in public office. On Wednesday, democrats got a chance to grill President Donald Trump\\'s point person on deregulation as Andrew Wheeler came to Capitol Hill for his confirmation hearing to be the next permanent administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. For most of his presidency, the Republican has demanded sharp cuts to legal immigration, and has made this a non-negotiable element of any deal. They came to the United States from all corners of the globe -- Somalia, Rwanda, El Salvador, the Balkans, Germany, Iraq -- claiming to have been persecuted but, in reality, they were the persecutors. Restrictions to health care organizations that work on family planning as known as the global gag rule does extensive harm to women, especially in developing countries, but it’s nevertheless been embraced by every recent Republican administration.\\n Trump is “angry” that intelligence officials informed Sanders and other members of Congress about some of Russia’s meddling efforts in the 2020 election cycle, Biden said, adding that the administration must do more to secure the integrity of our elections. For some years now, conservative and libertarian education policy experts have warned against voucher systems in favor, instead, of tax-credit scholarships and education savings accounts, which are less likely to drag the regulations and mandates of government schools into the private arena. Proponents of stricter protections for students argue the DOE’s recent rollback of Obama-era rules aimed at protecting students from predatory for-profit colleges will only lead to even more student defaulting on their loans. Derrick Morgan, senior vice president for federal and regulatory affairs for oil lobby group American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFRM), bragged about how successful the industry has been in pushing anti-protest legislation, Taken together, these trends leave many young Americans feeling trapped. If they don’t go to college, they have little chance of getting a steady, well-paying job. If they do go to college they’ll be on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars in student loans.   But the skeptics have taken on a brasher, bolder tone in recent months.  President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would become the first U.S. leader to attend the March for Life, one of the nation’s largest anti-abortion protests, in person later this week. The move is likely to be seen as an attempt by the president to appeal to his evangelical base at a time of fierce political turmoil. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shredded a House Democratic anti-corruption proposal on Wednesday over a provision that would make going to the polls a national holiday. The safe, heavily researched HPV vaccine remains tragically under-used — and anti-vaccine movies and conferences could make it more so if we’re not careful. Samoa on Thursday closed all non-essential public and private services for two days to combat a measles epidemic that has killed more than 60 people, mostly babies and children, in a battle complicated by a vocal anti-vaccination movement. President Donald Trump touted how his reversal of Obama-era regulations on the fossil fuel industry has led to the United States being the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world during his State of the Union address on Tuesday at the U.S. Capitol. After winning his 15th major championship, the legendary golfer Tiger Woods got a chance to laugh at all who doubted him. Schlapp’s apology comes as the U.S. is convulsed by protests after the police killing in Minnesota last month of a black man, George Floyd, by a white police officer, who knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. That officer has been charged with second degree murder and three fellow officers have been charged in abetting Floyd’s death. Day said that some Democrats had phoned her to say they would not vote for Hillary Clinton because of her extreme pro-abortion stance. The disqualification was emblematic of what many women who wear hijabs go through while participating in sports. Polling throughout the Democratic primary showed Sanders triumphing with young voters by massive margins, and early polling in the general election has shown Biden running weaker with younger voters than past Democratic nominees. Several medical and advocacy groups have insisted abortion services should be considered as essential health care during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and not subject to delays or a reduction of availability that will affect other health services. Proposals to restructure repayment programs or dip into retirement accounts don’t prevent students from taking out dangerous amounts of student loans in the first place. Big Labor is not buying the Democrats\\' Green New Deal, saying the proposed economic and energy reforms could cause “immediate harm” to millions of union employees and threaten their livelihoods. Former Defense Secretary William Cohen on Friday called out President Donald Trump’s violent rhetoric about anti-racism protesters, warning the White House is “leading us down the trail toward a dictatorship.” Two years after the Trump administration made the state-sanctioned kidnapping of children at the border official U.S. policy, the horrors around this crime against humanity continue to be exposed. Over the past few decades, RFK Jr.’s famous name has helped him get in the door to talk to important people, and it probably isn’t long before the person who is all jacked up to meet a Kennedy realizes the guy is totally cray-cray. Thunberg lambasted business and political elites gathered at WEF Tuesday for not doing enough to tackle climate change, warning that time was running out. Since the Democrat Congress and the Obama administration orchestrated the government takeover of student loans in 2010 the total amount of student loan debt has exploded. The argument that the real way to end abortion is to make abortion unnecessary by establishing a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state salves left-wing Christians\\' consciences for their support of radically pro-abortion politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders. The ideas promoted by anti-vaccination groups — which rely on pseudoscience and conspiracy theories about the government and pharmaceutical companies — are false. Liberal economist and New York Times opinion writer Paul Krugman, in a scathing column this week, warns that extreme events like the wildfires that have been devastating Australia are a preview of things to come — and he stresses that right-wing politicians who deny the reality of climate change are as great a threat as the events themselves. Racist Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said generations of people would not be here without rape and incest while making the case for anti-abortion legislation without exceptions for victims of those crimes. Trump used to say that Mexico will pay for the wall, but since that is impossible, he has endorsed the bizarre claim that the wall will pay for itself. In Philadelphia, there were also reports that the city was ignoring social distancing standards by cramming their new voting machines (one per jurisdiction) into multi-precinct voting locations, which forced voters and poll workers to stand on top of each other. President Donald Trump surprised reporters at the White House briefing room on Thursday, continuing his demand for wall funding. Now, the data shows there is an aftershock in the form of the looming tsunami of student debt defaults that will hit communities of color the hardest, according to data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics and Demos, a progressive think tank. While the majority of Americans seem to accept scientific information about the deadly coronavirus and are wary of reopening the country before we can be sure it’s safe, one segment of the population is driving the opposite narrative. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces. Since Roe v. Wade, when the Supreme Court recognized the constitutional right to an abortion, state lawmakers have devised novel ways to cut off access to the procedure without banning it outright. One strategy is to require clinics and doctors to comply with an ever-expanding list of regulations, with the goal of essentially red-taping providers out of business. A three-year-old girl in China’s Jiangsu province died after receiving a rabies vaccination last month, an ominous development in light of persistent scandals over low-quality and improperly-handled vaccines. Democrats have seethed as they helplessly watched the Trump administration undo or block a slew of Obama-era environmental proposals during the past two years. Despite achieving a historic position of leadership in the highest level of national football, Sowers said she experienced LGBTQ discrimination in sports while in college, when was rejected from a volunteer coaching job because of her “lifestyle.” The damages bankruptcy inflicts on debtors looks appealing to the twenty percent who say they’ll be in debt until they die. Obama’s proposed change could start a run that would greatly increase costs to the federal government and, by extension, taxpayers. Their work came on the heels of an IPCC report that warned of dire environmental, economic and health consequences in the absence of any serious momentum toward decarbonization by 2030. The doctors note that continuing abortions – some of which are likely to develop complications – place greater stress on a healthcare system that is under tremendous pressure at the current time. And while states like Massachusetts—among others—automatically cancel debt if a borrower dies or becomes disabled, New Jersey has chosen a different path, encouraging students to buy life insurance to cover their debt and take co-signers off the hook in the event of a tragedy Trump, who has been critical of the Iraq war, in a tweet called Powell “a real stiff.” Powell is the latest former top military officer to rebuke Trump in the wake of sweeping mass protests aimed at fighting racial injustice spurred by the May 25 death of an unarmed black man in Minnesota. In a September executive order, President Donald Trump gave states and local governments the right to reject refugees, but instead of saying no, most state and local officials have blindsided the administration by opting in, according to two former officials familiar with the matter. This group is small but vocal, and represents a predictable if threatening merging of forces. Trump likes to tell this story with vivid and completely made-up details about swaddling a baby in blankets before murdering it. The Senate held hearings in which anti-choice activist Jill Stanek — a crazed, racist liar who also claims Chinese people think aborted fetuses are a “delicacy” — claimed, almost certainly falsely, that she once witnessed a baby being killed this way.  Americans Need To Stop Hurrying Young People Into Student Debt Slavery. Above all, we must give high schoolers personalized post-secondary educational recommendations before they get caught in the quagmire of student debt. When it comes to the Green New Deal blueprint to address the climate crisis, Republicans generally like to pretend it calls for the elimination of hamburgers. The whole anti-vaxx (as it became known) thing was nuts, a way for fading celebrities to pretend to be the vanguard of a Great Cause that Saved The Children from a sinister government conspiracy. It was not stingy family leave policies that had this baby killed, it was the child’s mother, encouraged and enabled by a culture and legal regime that regard babies as a capstone consumer commodity to be ordered up when convenient, and violently disposed of when inconvenient. President Donald Trump has characterized those clashing with law enforcement after George Floyd’s death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer as organized, radical-left thugs engaging in domestic terrorism, an assertion repeated by Attorney General William Barr. But opponents argued that asking minors to negotiate the legal system when they are already scared and ashamed could drive them to illegal abortions. The words and notions of all these documents (Green New Deal, Venezuelan Constitution, UN Covenant “International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights”, Stalin-written Soviet Constitution) may sound good to some, but in the end, they are just empty words at best, a siren call for the naïve, beckoning them to a socialist utopia, and at worst, lip service meant to distract from totalitarian brutality. I get that the media really want to do some bullcrap horse-race point-scoring partisan sniping right now. But these are actually important questions. And “gotcha” reporting may get you butt-slapped by your fellow reporters at the bar, but it’s actually really dangerous. Despite a pandemic, one-sided presidential nomination contests, and nationwide protests about police violence and racial equality, the primaries were important — and instructive.  The Georgia Democrats took wire hangers and bottles of bleach to the House floor in protest as symbols of the self-induced abortions that many desperate women dangerously attempt when the aid of a doctor isn’t available or allowed. The government of the secretive central Asian nation Turkmenistan published photos of what it claimed to be thousands of cyclists celebrating World Health Day on Tuesday with a crowded ride through the nation’s capital, Ashgabat – one of several sporting events seemingly held with no concern for the Chinese coronavirus. Transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox twice broke a female opponent’s skull to win matches and now he is being praised by some in the LGBT community. The Bezos Earth Fund may help shepherd along some new technologies, but billionaire philanthropy will not alter the regulatory structure that created the problem in the first place. Much of this health hazard lies at the feet of folks like RFK Jr., so the idea that Trump was doing the anti-vax slow-jam with this quack a week before Inauguration Day understandably put Twitterverse over the edge That meant anyone walking into a branch with a certain level of assets instantly became a target for multiple offers. Customers with lower incomes were less of a priority, increasingly treated as little more than a source of fee harvesting. Corinthian College Inc. is the bankrupted and criminal organization that Marco Rubio was defending just this past year, probably because he got a boatload of money from them in campaign organizations. Over the past 10 years it has come to light—through numerous lawsuits and state and federal investigations—that untold billions of dollars has been swindled out of student and taxpayers’ pockets by this private educational company. Home Secretary Priti Patel said that in response to the surge of illegal migrants, the government will look into how to speed up the deportation process, possibly to be modelled on Australia’s uncompromising system which saw a steep decline in illegal migration under the Commonwealth’s “stop the boats” policy. President Donald Trump in an interview on Tuesday mocked former Vice President Joe Biden for continuing to wear a mask. The president pointed to a speech that Biden gave on Tuesday about race relations, where the former vice president removed his mask. When the men’s basketball Final Four tips off Saturday in Minneapolis, the NCAA’s biggest and most lucrative event will proceed as it normally does: the athletes on the floor for Virginia and Auburn, Michigan State and Texas Tech, will play games that generate hundreds of millions of dollars in total revenue for their schools, the NCAA and broadcast companies, the coaches and athletic directors, TV executives and NCAA suits will share in the riches but athletes themselves still won’t receive their fair share ― and thanks to a recent federal court decision, that won’t change in the immediate future.  Climate Wunderkind Greta Thunberg has garnered gushing praise from celebrities during her environmental crusade. And his demagoguery around the Central American immigrant caravans and asylum-seekers continually obscure the fact that asking for asylum is an entirely legal form of immigration — even though Trump and his defenders now like to call it a “loophole.” Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) immigration plan, which opens the border to all foreign nationals, was drafted by a handful of illegal alien staffers. Oprah Schools Instagram Hater With Receipts After Student Loan Diss First Joe Biden said he still supported the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions, , then changed his position one day later, after tremendous political pressure from farther-left Democrats. Drowned out by the algorithm: Vaccination advocates struggle to be heard online President Donald Trump sparked ire on Tuesday after he spread yet another conspiracy theory, this time about wind farms. The number of abortions performed in 2017-2018 was 11,373 more than the abortions performed the year before that, a trend that shows that while Planned Parenthood officials once said abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” today they omit the word “rare” in their mantra as they perform more abortions each year. Yet the drumbeat for censorship goes on as the politicians whose ideas find favor with the mainstream media want to make sure theirs are the only ideas you ever get to hear. Today it will be about money, but only because money is the means to spread ideas. Women’s rights advocates were relieved late Monday when Senate Democrats blocked an extreme anti-choice bill from advancing to a floor debate—but were soon outraged by President Donald Trump’s lies about abortion care, as well as the corporate media for enabling his blatantly false characterization of the bill to stand. Merril Hoge, one of the most outspoken critics against the alarm surrounding CTE studies, also underscored that, from his lens, demonizing sports like football does more harm to American children than good. The fact that the abortion rate among American blacks is far higher than the rate for whites is routinely chronicled and mourned. After tremendous pressure on the Department of Homeland Security, Miller is advancing his agenda of not just blocking migrants from entering the country illegally, but making life in the U.S. so unbearable for legal immigrants that they leave the country. Many of the U.S. Border Patrol agents on the front lines of the U.S. effort to secure the southern border with Mexico bristle at what they see as public misconceptions and media mischaracterization of their work. Never before have the freewheeling inclinations of some Electoral College members flipped an election, so the impact of the high court\\'s decision may be just mathematical. On one hand, naive teenagers who signed off their financial futures to leftist, anti-American institutions would catch a break. The college cartel screwed you; now here’s a government waiver to make you forever grateful to the Democrats.  Father Horan was one of the many voices from the Catholic Left who joined the mainstream media lynching of students from Covington Catholic High School this weekend, rashly judging them as racists without bothering to ascertain what actually happened, simply because some of the boys were wearing MAGA hats. Coronavirus vaccine and quarantine protesters in America form an unholy COVID-19 alliance. Trump attacking wind power is nothing new. There are no more major cases against the NCAA proceeding currently, but Wilken has slowly eroded some of the NCAA’s favorite arguments and restrictions. In the case of student debt cancellation, they also force people to make painful choices: Does a young couple put off getting married to get their student debt reduced? Do they wait another year before taking good jobs, so that they qualify? Must a struggling young person stay away from his parents’ home and couch-surf for a year to obtain the benefit? Of course, social distancing will be inconceivable for football players and the results all too predictable in a world in which Covid-19 is likely to hang around for a long, long time.  Many are mocking the president’s astonishing lack of understanding about even the most basic concepts of vaccines and how drug tests on them are performed. The Democratic Party’s electorate is less enthusiastic about the 2020 election than their Republican counterparts, according to a HuffPost/YouGov survey, a split in attitudes that existed before the coronavirus pandemic caused voters of all ideological and partisan stripes to become less gung-ho about casting ballots in November. Sen. Elizabeth Warren\\'s radical immigration plans involves decriminalizing illegal immigration, increasing legal immigration, and ending all detention of illegal aliens, minus those deemed to be “a flight or safety risk.” Though Trump has not been as outspoken on vaccines as president as he was in the past, he has repeatedly falsely suggested that vaccines cause autism.  In a part of the country where the rules about who can access abortion care vary dramatically from state to state, the COVID-19 pandemic has sewn another layer of confusion. Climate change, which is the subject of fierce debate, may lead to a \"substantial increase\" in the number of extreme rainstorms, according to a startling new study by NASA. Donald Trump appeared to make some important news via Twitter last night, announcing a dramatic new plan to use Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to remove “millions” of people from American soil. This is all great news. It now looks like we have a safe, highly effective vaccine that has the potential to significantly reduce many forms of cancer. So why is it also becoming a key target of many anti-vaxxers? While falling short of calling half the nation “deplorable” as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did in 2016, the comments echo a deep disdain for a large population of the country increasingly perpetuated by left-wing elites in the wake of the George Floyd protests characterizing the U.S. as irredeemably racist. This is how Warren has pushed the boundaries of progressive policy since coming to Washington. Instead of relying on the traditional D.C. think tank world, she made her office into her very own think tank. Harris is also pushing legislation that would dramatically expand the legal and financial incentives for hundreds of thousands of Indian low-wage college graduates to take U.S.-based jobs from U.S. college graduates. The looting and riots and fires in blue cities across the country today reaffirm that it is not “justice” but “war” that today’s radicals have in mind. From a moment that brought all Americans together in their sense of right and wrong, politicians and groups bent on destabilizing the nation chose division…and got their way. Instead, they want to force women and their doctors to subject dying newborns to further horrific medical intervention, to needles and lights and loud voices and scalpels and machines that will only prolong the inevitable, only prolong their pain. Former Vice President Al Gore turned up the rhetorical heat during a conference in Atlanta on Thursday, where he warned that climate change could bring about the end of civilization. Things look less promising in the U.S. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed that the Trump administration had relaxed enforcement of regulations to help polluting industries deal with the pandemic. Of course, the famously corrupted higher education sports market is a happy NFL partner and crime may pay after all, as it often does in the Trump league. For one thing, his plan would slash subsidized student loan repayment plans, and let the government crack down on missed payments. To left-wing politicians who think the state should hand out more subsidies, this might as well have been Armageddon. Overwhelming evidence shows that vaccination — including the flu shot — is safe. And all major medical groups urge nearly everyone over age six months to get the yearly flu vaccine. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro wants you to know that he’s so pro-life, he wouldn’t even consider aborting baby Hitler. When President Trump rolled out his recent budget proposal, it made some cuts that were always going to cause controversy. For one thing, his plan would slash subsidized student loan repayment plans, and let the government crack down on missed payments. Proponents of these vaccines twist the Vatican’s words to sound like approval: The use of such vaccines... However, social media watchdogs are foaming at the mouth over the choice to place a teen climate activist on a panel with public health experts. In an era in which domestic terrorism is an increasingly deadly societal scourge, it’s dangerous when a sitting American president lies to rabid followers with tales of infants being executed in medical facilities. Coach Guerrier adds that the referee’s continued mid-game scrutiny ultimately made “a spectacle” of her daughter, and that he continued to insist that something would have to be done as the child grows up and continues to compete in the sport. A 10-hour hearing broadcast on the court’s website showed Sun, China\\'s greatest ever swimmer, and one of its biggest sports stars, to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English. After President Donald Trump’s news conference on a positive jobs report Friday morning, the mainstream media contorted a quote from the president to falsely convey he thinks George Floyd is happy about the jobs numbers. But, yeah, good work each and every one of you reporters who made this fake story something to waste time on this week. You’re all hacks. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Thursday released a sweeping immigration plan that would dramatically increase the number of refugee admissions by nearly 800 percent from FY 2018 and 250 percent from the Obama years. Democrats are gearing up to turn abortion into a key issue for the 2020 elections, saying it could turn out to be an issue that mirrors the fight to preserve the Affordable Care Act in 2018.  But so many anti-vaxxers add selfishness to their faults and put innocent children, who because of age or immune system deficiencies cannot be vaccinated, in danger. The American Petroleum Institute\\'s (API\\'s) estimates were released two days before South Carolina\\'s Democratic primary, where the candidates will compete with platforms that push aggressive agendas on energy and the environment. Last summer, the Republican White House announced plans to roll back the tougher standards, making it easier for the automotive industry to sell less efficient vehicles that pollute more. Trump, who opted against giving a Super Bowl pregame interview last year, made several eyebrow-raising remarks during his interview with host Margaret Brennan, touching on topics including his plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and whether he would let his 12-year-old son play football. Donald Trump, who was pro-choice in the not-too-distant past and never fit the mold of a far-right culture-war crusader, has taken a keen interest in abortion rights lately. According to Planned Parenthood office in Roanoke, Virginia, the abortion giant will continue to perform abortion services during the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming abortion is an “essential” medical service. As banks leave low-income communities and jack up the cost of basic financial services such as checking accounts, many Americans instead have to rely on expensive and often predatory “fringe banking” institutions, such as check-cashing businesses, payday lenders and pawnshops. This is one of the reasons why our politics seems so stuck. Not only do we have a hard time talking to each other, the very structure of our elections doesn’t require our politicians to even try. And when you win by turning out the base, why risk appealing to anyone else? A broken system not only elects politicians who need not listen to everyone, it actually incentivizes them to govern that way too. But director Nick Sweeney’s forthcoming documentary on McCorvey, “AKA Jane Roe,” contains a major bombshell: her conversion from abortion rights icon to born-again Christian abortion opponent was “all an act.” Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio is a vocal climate change activist, however, he has taken some heat in the past for his preference for fuel-guzzling private plane travel. This unholy, unscientific alliance of right-wingers, COVID-19 truthers and anti-vaxxers became very clear recently following the viral spread of an anti-COVID-19 propaganda movie called “Plandemic,” featuring disgraced scientist-turned-anti-vaxxer ... The “baby parts” debacle from a few years ago is another example of how the anti-choice movement is not a group sober-minded devout Christians who just love “life,” but in fact a bunch of fanatics who have contempt for the truth and think nothing of spinning wild stories and engaging in implausible thought-experiments in their efforts to smear feminists. Of all the pandering showcased during Democrats’ attempts to win back the presidency, wiping out student debt ranked at or near the top. This would not be the first time Biden has been criticized for his ideas on combatting climate change, which – in the past – have paled in comparison to the ideas offered by ultra-progressive Sanders, who rolled out a massive $16 trillion Green New Deal plan this week. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, emboldened pro-life groups have used the public health crisis to try to disrupt access to abortion. It probably has something to do with Pitlyk being a Federalist Society member, a former Brett Kavanaugh clerk, and a fierce opponent of reproductive rights who’s argued that fertility treatments and surrogacy have “grave” adverse effects on society. Sanders praises the radical Green New Deal, champions a Medicare for All plan with a $34 trillion price tag, nods to abortion as a means of population control, and defends bread lines and Fidel Castro’s Cuba.  Debates about the viability of school voucher programs have focused in recent months on programs with lackluster or spotty academic records. But there’s another issue raised by the potential expansion of public financing for private schools: an exacerbation of segregation. After witnessing the right-wing reaction to Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden who spoke at the United Nations this week, there can be no doubt that modern-day conservatism, especially the Republican Party, functions primarily as a protection racket for the fragile egos of mediocre white men.  Emilie Kao went on to note that women’s sports has already been undermined by the transgender movement. It remains to be seen how players — whose wages span a wide spectrum in a league with no salary cap — will respond to the request following calls from government ministers to cut their often-astronomical wages. But the timing made the mailer less of an attack than an argument in favor of Lewis George: It arrived in mailboxes as protests over police killings of Black people, including George Floyd in Minneapolis, broke out nationwide and sparked calls for massive overhauls of police departments across the country. Coronavirus vaccine and quarantine protesters in America form an unholy COVID-19 alliance. These groups have converged to spread the same dangerous and self-defeating message. Although U.S.-based sporting goods companies now produce almost none of their own gear, increasing the cost of imports from China could still jeopardize thousands of U.S. white collar jobs in design, product development, and sales and marketing. As leading 2020 Dems advocate spending big on the Green New Deal, it turns out most Americans are worried about other issues. The specter of “abortion regret” has been used by lawmakers and judges alike to impose or uphold rules making it harder for people to get abortions. But the national and global trends spin a tale of two separate realities. An irrational fear of vaccines among well-educated and largely white Americans has fueled an utterly preventable and dangerous disease that had been considered “eliminated” by scientists. China – the country that throws its minorities into concentration camps and uses them for slave labor, the brutal authoritarian regime driven by Han Chinese racial supremacist ideology, the government that thinks nothing of wiping out entire villages if it needs to build a few dams quickly to put on a good show for the Olympics – boasted of its superior compassion and tolerance in the pages of the CCP’s Global Times on Monday Reporting from Buzzfeed News Thursday evening exposed how President Donald Trump’s immigration policies led to four deaths and preventable surgeries for children held in the administration’s detention regime, including one eight-year-old boy whose forehead was partially removed. In the seven years since, Warren has become the most active politician in America when it comes to investigating, transforming and eliminating student debt. President Donald Trump says that voting by mail is “horrible” and “corrupt” because the “tremendous potential for voter fraud” helps Democrats win elections. But county-level election supervisors in his home state of Florida — where he recently cast a vote for himself, by mail — disagree, and are doing everything they can to ensure this crucial swing state can hold a safe election during the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, a pervasive celebrity culture — in which celebrities are considered trusted “experts” solely because of their fame — has poisoned the idea of what constitutes expertise. That Sanders’ proposal lacks any sort of means-testing requirement makes it clear that he believes this is something all people deserve, but it’s unclear why, or how that’s a worthwhile investment given that it will be allocated toward those who are relatively rich (or could have been relatively rich had they not gotten a useless master’s degree that doesn’t translate into higher earnings).  Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden, the 16-year-old’s steely-eyed courage has helped inspire kids across the country — and the world — to join her call to strike from school last week and stand up for more aggressive action to combat the climate crisis. Lexington’s Bishop John Stowe is admonishing Covington Catholic students insisting that the teens can’t claim to be “pro-life” while supporting a president who “denigrates” immigrants and refugees. Officials at Dartmouth College looked the other way this week when a group of leftist student activists disrupted classes to bring attention to their support for the Green New Deal. How anti-vaxxers target grieving moms and turn them into crusaders against vaccines Chinese state media outlets have been bursting with criticism for President Donald Trump during the current round of riots, but the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also tossed a few bricks at former President Barack Obama and his Democrat Party, needling them for doing little about racial issues and touting China’s efforts to care for its poor and disenfranchised as vastly superior to the Democrats’ half-hearted socialism. If Trump’s actions threatened to turn the culture war into an active shooting war, that would just be collateral damage on the road to his political recovery. Maynor’s story underscores a harsh reality: Youth sports is a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and not every kid has the chance to participate. Reilly also suggested that Trump’s “grudge” against Puerto Rico correlates with a soured golf course deal on the island, and explained why the sport may be responsible for Trump’s embrace of a wild conspiracy theory about wind turbines causing cancer. Although Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg specified that her donation to Planned Parenthood Action Fund was a personal one, and not associated with Facebook, it is worth noting that in the last year the social media giant Sandberg leads has been caught censoring pro-life political ads. Biden, who based his successful bid for the Democratic nomination on the importance of defeating Trump and returning to normalcy, had long resisted calls to eliminate student debt. Even a member of French President Emmanuel Macron’s La République en Marche! (LREM/Republic on the Move) slammed the sports hijab. The media have tried to convince voters of Trump\\'s failure for many years, but have thus far been unable to do so. Tuesday\\'s special elections show we should hold off on the \"Blue Wave\" and \"Trump can\\'t win\" narratives. At least Morrissey, who stepped into his son’s life after an unexpected pregnancy, chose life — unlike Northam, who supports late-term abortion and advocates for killing unwanted children after failed abortions. Some people have expressed concern that full cancellation could reward wealthier—and whiter—people, who are less in need than others. But full cancellation will reduce the racial wealth gap.  Ever since Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) revealed her plan to forgive student debt and make public universities free on Monday morning, the internet has been a carnival of bad faith, magical thinking and misinformation about the nature of college costs in the United States. The issue of mandatory vaccination is once again an item of debate in media circles given the recent outbreaks in measles, and fueled this week by the continued inability of politicians to discuss vaccination policy without sounding like anti-science fools. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has recently donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood Action Fund. In an interview with HuffPost, Sandberg said she was motivated by the “draconian laws” protecting unborn children recently passed in red states like Alabama, Missouri, and Georgia. While each sport has its own rules with regards to religious headwear, Muslim women who compete while wearing a hijab have faced a litany of obstacles. Indeed, that original NYT report suggested that the management at Trump’s club in New Jersey was well aware of the fact that it employed undocumented immigrants, and it deliberately took steps to obscure the fact that it broke the law – repeatedly, over the course of several years. For a fleeting moment on Tuesday, the political universe was kumbayaing in mutual disgust at Donald Trump’s meeting with Robert Kennedy Jr. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo was quick to defend climate activist Greta Thunberg from \"Trumpers\" who mocked her on Thursday but was quickly reminded about the settlement his network recently made with Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann. Yet it\\'s merely the tip of the iceberg of war criminals lurking -- and working -- on U.S. turf. The result was a mess: car manufacturers, which had already begun taking steps to comply with the Obama-era tough fuel-efficiency standards for the auto industry, faced the prospect of having to make different vehicles to sell in different parts of the country. But even as the job losses mounted into the tens of millions as the nation rushed to try to contain an already widespread pandemic, the President personally promoted miracle quack cures like hydroxychloroquine and demonstrated his unbridled personal buffoonery by wondering aloud about the possibility of drinking bleach and injecting sunlight as a method of curing oneself of coronavirus. President of Belarus refuses to cancel sports and scoffs at ‘Psychosis’ of coronavirus measures. For far too many on the left, chaos is the point. Destruction is the goal. They prefer the unknown madness that lies ahead to whatever is still managing to (barely) hold us together in the present. The New York Times recently published a fairly detailed fact-check of these Trump World arguments that democrats don’t mind executing babies after birth, and not surprisingly, the rhetoric is irresponsibly wrong. Netflix\\'s statements related to leaving Georgia if fetal heartbeat law goes into effect is the company’s way of firing a warning shot to Georgia and similar states: Conform to our Hollywood ideals and values, or we won’t give you our business. How do we deal with the false perception that liberals are more inclined to trust science than conservatives? Or, how do we approach the media’s fondness for focusing on the unscientific views of some conservatives but ignoring the irrational—and oftentimes, more consequential—beliefs of their fellow liberals? Tokyo Games is even more of a dream fulfilled for the small baseball community in Israel, comprised mostly of American immigrants, and which has languished for decades in the country’s sporting wilderness. As the ranks of Democratic Party 2020 presidential hopefuls continue to swell and Trump’s chaotic lawlessness proliferates it’s easy to miss a deepening crisis that’s already taking a toll on millions of households and is about to get much worse. Indeed, just this week, Donald Trump, who once said the climate crisis was a hoax concocted by the Chinese, marveled at cold temperatures throughout the Midwest, convinced that the frigid weather is evidence of … something. Biel is merely the latest Hollywood celebrity to lend their support to the controversial anti-vaccine movement, which has been outright rejected and criticized by the scientific community. Last week, Ankara broke the 2015 agreement with Brussels in which it would stop the illegal flow of migrants through Turkey in exchange for money and continuing EU accession talks, and opened the gates which resulted in thousands of migrants amassing on the near-east country’s land border with Greece. When did vaccines become politicized? Amid a measles outbreak, suddenly Republicans support anti-vaxxers. U.S. women’s soccer team co-captain Megan Rapinoe is begging prominent male soccer stars to must begin agitating for political causes. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Tuesday blasted President Donald Trump’s response to U.S. protests over racism and police misconduct, vowing to try to heal the country’s racial divide and not “fan the flames of hate.” Republicans will claim that they prioritize pro-life policies, and democrats will keep abortion sacrosanct. The second side is represented by lenders, who – in my view – do little to assess an individual’s ability to repay a student loan. If a student borrows to enroll in a program, limits placed on amounts borrowed are quite high when federal and private loans are combined. Those losses could be offset by efforts from activist group’s such as Ralph Reed’s Christian Coalition, which plans to spend tens of millions of dollars to identify and register new religious conservative voters and rallying right-wing Christians. Because Trump’s plan to gut pollution safeguards was so drastic that many states announced plans to enforce stricter emissions standards on their own. So, imagine the gall it would take to knock Winfrey for not being charitable enough. That’s what happened when a salty Instagram user slid into the comments under a photo Winfrey posted celebrating the graduates of Colorado College From wildfires in Australia and California to hurricanes and flooding in Florida, a variety of extreme events will become more severe and more common as climate change accelerates. The decision upends a determination by Republican Secretary of State Tre Hargett’s office that fear of catching or unwittingly spreading the virus at the polls wouldn’t qualify someone to vote by mail, The state argued such an expansion wouldn’t be feasible for the 2020 elections, claiming lack of money, personnel and equipment for increased voting by mail, among other concerns. Ingraham began the exchange by noting American graduates’ salaries have been suppressed by the flood of foreign graduates. Should China be the first country to develop an effective vaccine, dictator Xi Jinping has promised to provide the world with “free” coronavirus vaccines paid for by Beijing.  The right to abortion is just that — the right to kill unborn humans. But pro-abortionists like Quinn and Cuomo find it easier to argue that they are fighting for “reproductive rights” (even though pro-lifers are not objecting to any woman’s right to reproduce) or that fetuses are not humans but “clumps of cells.” Just as with slave owners and eugenicists before them, it’s easier for pro-abortionists to advocate for murder after they’ve dehumanized the lives they want to end. Breaking store windows, setting buildings on fire, vandalizing monuments to American heroes, leaving graffiti threats on synagogue walls, attacking Christian churches and tombstones, terrorizing the living, and giving no peace to the dead— these are the great accomplishments of Antifa and those they egg on. Conway recycled a right-wing talking point that falsely claims a bill designed to loosen certain restrictions on late-term abortions in Virginia is “infanticide” during her Monday appearance on “Outnumbered Overtime with Harris Faulkner.” Anti-vaccine groups take dangerous online harassment into the real world Democrats have made it clear they will sandbag the people we’ve elected to govern if we refuse to vote for Democrats.  China appears to be feeding off similar complaints from the left in the United States. Complaints about partisan “gridlock” are perennial and grow especially loud when Democrats and their highly sympathetic media are the ones complaining about Republicans getting in their way. In Washington, three key issues seemed to galvanize most of the protesters: climate change, immigration and reproductive rights. In practice, that means it\\'s hard to trust Bezos\\' pledge when Amazon, the source of his wealth, has been aggressively courting oil and gas companies with its cloud computing services and threatened workers who campaigned for stronger climate action with dismissal.  There can be no serious discussion of this issue, however, in 60-second sound bites. So, beyond the soak-the-rich shtick that shades every Democratic economic debate point, the candidates resorted to two tactics: shock and sob stories. Trump’s approval rating remains resilient at around 40%, with a large majority of Republicans still approving of his overall performance. But sustained pessimism among Trump’s supporters could portend potential weakness ahead of November’s election, when he will face Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, experts said. Smith’s announcement Sunday at the all-male, historically black college in Atlanta, Georgia provoked impassioned calls for both making higher education free across the country and canceling student debt. Impeachment Is Just Another Word For Delusional Democrats Holding The Nation Hostage Though  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was by no means the first to describe migrant detention centres as concentration camps — disgraced Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio boasted his “tent city” in the Sonora Desert was just that — her comments ignited a firestorm of controversy. For starters, Gautney, per her Twitter profile, is an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University, a private school located in New York City. None of this is a problem on its own; in a free society, people should be able to tweet whatever dumb things they want while working in whichever industry or field of research. For several years, climate change doomsayers have turned their attention to cattle, as a series of reports demonstrated that “livestock emissions” are more dangerous for the environment than automobiles. Unbelievably, with all they had seen their child suffer, his parents not only refused the doctor’s suggestion that he receive another DTaP vaccination they also declined all the other scheduled vaccinations the boy had missed. Yet it far better applies to unelected career bureaucrats’ use of their power to prosecute their political enemies, which comprises the heart of the “resistance” to Republican rule that will endure so long as bureaucracy has enough power to challenged elected branches of government. This bureacracy weaponization was also a hallmark of the Obama presidency, with — ironies of ironies — perhaps the biggest evidences again coming from the Department of Justice under attorneys general Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. The president’s likely opponent in the November elections, Democrat Joe Biden, was not among those who were inspired. Instead, tone-deaf as he is to the American people and the things of the Spirit, he said the president’s appearance outside the church shows he “is more interested in power than in principle.” During her acceptance speech for best actress in a limited television series for Fosse/Vernon, Williams went on a bizarre rant about the need for abortion rights in the United States and for American women to vote for pro-choice candidates during election years. The 2010s saw the U.S. economy achieve its longest-ever expansion, with notable milestones such as 110 months of uninterrupted job gains and an unemployment rate near a half-century low becoming easy bragging points for politicians and economists alike. Student loan debt is no doubt a drag on the U.S. economy, holding back how much money young consumers can spend on cars, homes and even invest in 401(k) plans or new businesses.  Donald Trump announced at the time that the Environmental Protection Agency would be led, at least temporarily, by Andrew Wheeler – a former lobbyist for, among others, Murray Energy, one of the nation’s largest coal companies and former chief counsel for Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the nation’s preeminent climate deniers. It is a monumental ode to human stupidity that the wealthiest nation in the world teeters on the edge of a dangerous measles epidemic at the same time that poor nations are struggling to vaccinate their residents.  Protecting pregnant women, new mothers and children is about more than scoring political points with anti-choice legislation. The failure to act to ameliorate global warming exposes the myth of human progress and the illusion that we are rational creatures.  A protester could be seen throwing an object at Frey as he slinked away. Biden, so far, has enjoyed the luxury of remaining in his basement, hidden away from volatile activists who want answers. Phoenix’s Oscar speech for Joker was a rambling discourse that veered in several direction before settling on environmental platitudes. But if you major in philosophy or gender studies, you might struggle to find any job in your field, let alone a well-paying one. Inhibiting travel and commerce—not to mention making consular interviews deeply intrusive on a gendered basis—by imposing restrictions on pregnant women is an alarmist reaction to a small issue. Major League Baseball is using its financial muscle to support the U.S. women\\'s softball team, which already is assured a spot in the Tokyo Olympics while the American men\\'s baseball team struggles to qualify. People from populations targeted by these immigration policies might also experience more discrimination, which worsens mental health. Six Republican Senators have failed to develop a coalition for their plan that exchanges a fifth of border wall funding for an amnesty for illegal aliens and increased immigration. Biden made the apocalyptic pronouncement while discussing climate change before a crowd of supporters in Peterborough, New Hampshire. There may be pushback among Democrats. If so, I hope the ones doing the pushing will reconsider. We have treated our younger generations, and many older people, unjustly. The act of recognizing an injustice we hadn’t seen before makes us more human and refines us as moral beings. But Americans who blame anti-vaccination parents and propaganda have it wrong. Yes, those who do not vaccinate their children play a role in our failing rates, and lies about vaccinations causing autism have made matters worse, but there are less known, more significant causes to poor completion rates in children.  This idea, gaining traction under the hashtag #CancelStudentDebt following the release of Sanders’ college debt forgiveness plan, is bad for several reasons, but naturally appealing in a sort of populist way, since plenty of people choose not to think about second-order impacts and potential consequences of driving our country into even more ruinous national debt than before. Trump reportedly told advisers during a “contentious” meeting on Monday that he wanted to deploy as many as 10,000 National Guard troops to D.C., Reuters reported. But Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and Attorney General William Barr reportedly pushed back. Actor and climate change activist Joaquin Phoenix was spotted at Oscars Party with plastic water bottle after climate change rant. Practicing pro-life litigators know that Trump judges are saving lives by permitting restrictions on abortion to go into effect. But even after contracting a life-threatening infection that might have been prevented by a vaccine, his family stood firm on their anti-vax stance.  Next came the sob stories. Those student loans are suffocating a generation, the candidates suggested. After all, “40 million of us who can’t start a family,” the diaper-changing daddy Swalwell contradictorily proclaimed, adding that they “Can’t take a good idea and start a business and can’t buy our first home.” For those who think this country needs baseball now to raise its depressed spirits, you might consider a cautionary historical precedent, the Summer of Swat of 1998. As a political calculation, it shows Biden’s campaign is confident about their standing with many suburban moderates who were swing voters in the past but have moved solidly into the Democratic Party during Trump’s presidency, offended by his bullying demeanor and chaotic style. For our friends on the Left, Trump’s refusal to wear a mask is irresponsible toxic masculinity that is sending the wrong message and getting people killed, even though Dr. Deborah Brix has explained it’s not much of a risk. Biden, meanwhile, to their minds is leading by example by wearing his mask even when there is no good reason he should. But there’s also an intensifying global climate crisis, which carries life-changing risks for billions of people. It’s a trap because a college education doesn’t guarantee a good job. For years, the return on investment for higher education has steadily declined. More than 40 percent of recent college graduates are underemployed and work in jobs that do not require a college education. Other than the fact that none of the above is even close to the truth and that the entire premise of the article is the fakest of fake news, the Daily Beast has a real bombshell on its hands. A slew of other world leaders and senior officials lined up to express their dismay over what they said was Trump\\'s willingness to hamper the WHO just when the world needs it the most. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump has hampered efforts to slow the virus’s spread and encouraged Americans’ restlessness under quarantine. This would be the same Taliban that gleefully murders young women for the crime of going to school and regards democracy as a crime against Islam punishable by death. But Trump and his most ardent supporters seem almost physically repulsed at the very idea of wearing a mask. One Republican Ohio state legislator even claimed that since “we are all created in the image and likeness of God,” covering the face with a mask is an affront to God’s creation. The man-made Amazon fires are for clearing the land of its forests and indigenous people. The benefits are for Jair Bolsonaro’s cronies, while producing a climate disaster for the world. Nevertheless, the media jihad continues, and that includes NBC shamelessly running a debunked and deceptive smear story that had been reported on and debunked all the way back in May. Tlaib charged that Israel is using U.S. funding to further its goal of an ethno-supremacist state. Of course, billionaires and corporations that reaped millions of dollars from the GOP tax cuts pumped some of that windfall into Republican campaigns, allowing Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to retain control of the Senate. The Christian Right, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers are so twisted that they have even turned Dr. Anthony Fauci into one of the objects of their hatred. Fauci, an expert immunologist who is part of Trump’s coronavirus task force, has had to increase his security detail because of death threats from extremists who believe he is exaggerating the threat in order to undermine Trump’s presidency. Until the last few years, all Washington could talk about was how to cut Social Security benefits, and by how much but a grass-roots progressive coalition began campaigning for expansion in 2013, and the idea has since moved straight to the heart of the Democratic Party. For Fox, Clinton, Omar, and Ocasio-Cortez represent perfect targets in terms of riling up its intolerant base: Clinton is a woman of a certain age, while Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are women of a certain heritage. Today’s mainstream media doesn’t want you to remember, but the early days of feminism were rife with ideological battles and  backstabbing that would put a medieval court to shame. A bold statement Wednesday from former Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis eviscerating Donald Trump has landed like a bomb in the Senate Republican caucus, sending members fleeing in all different directions. The justices threw out a challenge from gun rights groups. Apparently, even many people within the gun rights movement are concerned and are working to prevent people from openly bringing weapons to the rally but with leaders like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump rooting them on, the “good people” who will descend on Richmond on January 20 may feel like they have approval to light a spark. It was at this point that Trump thought it’d be a good idea to start bragging. More subtly, however, Pelosi is also using her gender to put Trump — who is visibly unnerved by having any woman around that isn’t clearly there to serve him, sexually or otherwise — on his heels.  India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is often compared to Donald Trump, especially when it comes to his anti-Muslim policies. Carmen Lodato wears a pin with her mother’s face — a reminder of the heart-wrenching murder six years ago in Alexandria, Va., that got her into the fight for gun control.  Palmer had been using the power of deputization to create a private armed force comprised of his political supporters—and he gave them tremendous powers, including the ability to harass his enemies. The tragedy of America’s 18 years in Afghanistan has been a stubborn refusal to admit the Afghan government is incapable of standing on its own, no matter how much money is poured into it, how much training its troops are given, or how many of its battles American soldiers fight. Sargent has written leftist pieces at the Washington Post for years. In March 2016, Sargent called then-candidate Donald Trump a “nightmare nominee,” saying that not even white men like Trump. Take, for example, the four reliably liberal Supreme Court justices, all of whom believe it’s OK to compel Americans to pay dues to political organizations they disagree with, to coerce them to say things they abhor, and to compel them to create things that undermine their principles. Suicide hotlines are overwhelmed. Unemployment is skyrocketing. Women and children in abusive relationships are stuck at home in a nightmare situation with their abusers. Alcohol sales are through the roof. Foster kids have nowhere to go to be loved and cared for. Bear in mind that none of these moneyed elites did anything to earn these extraordinary bonanzas. They didn’t work any harder, didn’t get smarter, didn’t add anything of value to society but simply reclined in luxury and let their money make money.  Right-wing media sprung into action to try to discredit her, of course, by implying that a woman who graduated summa cum laude with an economics degree is a bimbo and with  Twitchy using a screenshot to make the usually genial Ocasio-Cortez somehow look like a ballbuster. Rispone is crying foul about the race-baiting ads from Edwards’ allies. Perhaps the pushback from the Pentagon will increase the political cost, but if congressional Republicans won’t break with the president, then he’ll probably be able to create the carnage he seeks without too much difficulty. While it’s perfectly evident that Trump does have racist supporters (which he is suspiciously reluctant to condemn), many contend that Trumpism is itself not racist, but merely a justified reaction to the Left’s racial patronage. In an apparent attempt to divert attention from a lacklustre White House effort to counter the COVID-19 pandemic and a tone-deaf approach to racial injustice, President Donald Trump has entered into another of his many quagmires where he seems to have spoken first and contemplated later. Amazon first refused to publish a book skeptical of the mainstream narrative on the novel Wuhan coronavirus while still continuing to promote works by anarchists and Adolf Hitler. A year after a Democratic wave swept an unprecedented number of women and people of color into higher office all across America, and at a time when Trump’s approval rating is cratering, women should not be afraid of nominating another woman to drive Trump and his brand of pig-headed patriarchy out of the Oval Office. Gun enthusiasts cannot admit that they like firearms because they\\xa0fear black people. The media and the left did their best to ignore the racial diversity of the well-armed crowd. But the Christian Right embodies a dangerous form of Christianity that is bitterly anti-science, and its ideology goes hand in hand with white nationalism and the coronavirus truther movement. Trump again drew a misleading comparison between the coronavirus and the seasonal flu, telling his supporters that \"35,000 on average each year die from the flu, that\\'s a lot of people.\" The Obama and then the Trump administrations supported repressive and corrupt governments that followed Zelaya’s ouster, giving a green light to assassinations of dissidents and journalists, government-linked drug trafficking, and spiraling crime. Ocasio-Cortez used this weekend’s news cycle to continue highlighting the evils of wealth inequality, and to draw attention to serious policy fixes for the problem. The destruction of the middle class is destroying democracies and paving the way for authoritarian rule. China’s state-run media quickly seized on the obsessions of their American counterparts over the weekend by linking President Donald Trump to “white nationalism” President Donald Trump has picked his favorite weapon to fight the economic fallout from the coronavirus: an elimination of the “payroll tax” on workers’ gross earnings that is used to fund national retirement programs. Those areas have been plagued for years by gun and gang-related violence, including Englewood and West Garfield Park. It is unsurprising for biological males to destroy female records since men are physiologically stronger than woman, having more muscle mass and a higher bone density. Consistently, Trump has fed the menacing right-wing misinformation machine by repeatedly insisting that the virus is “going to go away.” He has systematically undermined his own top scientists and is now ignoring them altogether. MSNBC anchor Katy Tur on Wednesday boldly declared that there was “almost no middle class” in America. The U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen, the bloody war that Trump continued, over the bipartisan congressional objections, has generated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and it is farther than ever from success. Since the beginning, Biden has been grasping at the coattails of America’s first black president and relying on his administration’s laurels related to Obamacare, race relations, gun restrictions, and climate change. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a massive tax on the wealthiest Americans that aims to diminish income inequality -- a central theme of his campaign -- and at least begin to finance the steep price tags for the numerous government programs the Democratic presidential candidate is proposing. Democrats blocked a coronavirus package on Sunday that would provide economic relief to businesses and Americans suffering from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak The harshest attack on Trump and military action against civilians was issued in The Atlantic on Wednesday by former Defense Secretary and retired Marine Corps general Jim Mattis. He hailed peaceful protesters for working for a better future. Over 70,000 women in Germany have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM), and a further 17,000 young girls are at risk of having the barbaric procedure being committed against them. Outraged Democrats vowed to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that could undo the US health care law known as Obamacare, saying on Saturday that they will use their new power in Congress to hold Republicans responsible and “expose their lies.” But make no mistake about it: Despite receiving widespread positive attention from many in the press, Ocasio-Cortez’s radical left-wing policy proposals and her socialist ideology present a significant threat to America’s economy and its longstanding commitment to individual liberty.\\xa0 But in her rush for snarky liberal-bashing, Swoyer misses the real story about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s pricey haircut: the blatant and disparate “female tax” that women in power must pay to achieve and maintain their power. And while some of these more cartoonish members are still on Capitol Hill we’re occasionally reminded about the torch being passed to a new generation of lawmakers who are equally difficult to take seriously. It’s the golden age of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Coronavirus truthers ignorantly believe that the mainstream media, Democrats, liberals, progressives and Never Trump conservatives have been exaggerating the threat of COVID-19. But then, science has never been a strong point of the Christian Right or white nationalists. They are bitterly anti-science, which is why they so deeply resent anyone who offers accurate information on the pandemic — be it Dr. Fauci or reporters at CNN and MSNBC. It’s not a huge deal that an eccentric, pro-Trump activist clumsily used a bad analogy in a local speech. The analogy is bad enough, however, that it certainly shouldn’t be on the president’s Twitter feed. The Democrats’ bill is a massive giveaway to Silicon Valley, to tech donors, and to many Fortune 500 companies in the banking and insurance industries who have replaced their American graduates with blocs of imported Indian and Chinese workers. President Trump\\'s two-day visit to India turned to substance Tuesday after opening with a heavy dose of pomp and pageantry, but few concrete accomplishments were expected from the whirlwind trip. The new numbers from Gallup are an unwelcome sight for Democrats after kicking off the week with a disaster caucus in Iowa who and simultaneously anticipating a Trump acquittal in the Senate. Trump will also now have the opportunity to shine in his newfound approval in Tuesday night’s address to the nation while Democrats are in disarray. It would indeed be out of character for the Trump administration to take any firm stand against criminalizing homosexuality, since Trump — despite his campaign promises that he would live and let live — has been one of the most LGBTQ-hostile presidents in modern politics. Security measures are in place as there are concerns radical groups could face off in Richmond, but Democrat office holders and their surrogates in the gun control movement, as well as establishment media reporters, are\\xa0working\\xa0hard to paint the entire gun rally as a meeting of extremists and racists. And in return for the value you have created, the employment you have provided and the tax revenue you have generated, all you get is a bunch of chippy socialists and whiny Remoaners accusing you of being selfish, greedy, and unpatriotic. Tedros and his agency have been on the defensive after President Donald Trump of the United States — the WHO’s biggest single donor — last week ordered a halt to U.S. funding for the agency, alleging that it botched the early response to the outbreak. It’s no exaggeration to say that everything that Trump has done since then has been a pathetic effort to nuh-uh the hecklers and prove that he’s no #BunkerBoy, but a big, tough guy who will totally kick your ass without breaking a sweat. He’ll shove the White House doctor out to tell some more lies about Trump’s health, if that’s what it takes. A gaggle of representatives from theologically liberal denominations recently issued a statement against Christian nationalism in America, claiming that it threatens both American democracy and the ability of our religious communities to live in peace. Iowa farmers are bearing the brunt of the U.S. trade war with China as Donald Trump continues to threaten increased tariffs on Chinese imports. The note, which was full of anti-Semitic language and lauded white supremacy, named the Christchurch shooter and the man accused of fatally shooting 11 people. Throughout his presidency, Trump has shown a penchant for quick fixes and slapdash policies aimed at satisfying the short-term appetites of his base, no matter how much it hurts the country’s long-term welfare. Meanwhile, white supremacist propaganda distribution nearly tripled from 2017 to 2018, according to the ADL, which also documented a rise in racist rallies and demonstrations. Gun control advocates said gun rights groups are sowing fear during the pandemic in order to boost firearms sales, adding that increased gun ownership during the crisis could lead to more domestic violence. But behind the scenes, Trump was getting briefings. Terrible briefings. Really awful stuff. His own campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who was reported to have spent his hefty paycheck from the Trump campaign on condos, a luxury boat and a Ferrari, met with him and showed him his internal poll numbers. Democrats are shortsighted if they simply believe that creating new limits on gun ownership will increase Americans’ safety. While many women, and the men who love them, are well aware that, spurred on by the Vatican, United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and the so-called personhood movement, Republicans are working feverishly to eradicate women’s reproductive rights. Borrowing from Hillary Clinton, leftist Italian media have labeled those attending the pro-family Congress a “list of deplorables,” calling pro-life and pro-family advocates “neofascists” and “homophobes.” White nationalists also expressed excitement Tuesday about Trump\\'s plan to use an executive order to end \"birthright citizenship,\" the automatic grant of citizen status to anyone born in the United States. That has led to fears that gangs could exploit undocumented migrants already in the country for cheap labor, an established but illegal practice known as “caporalato” that one United Nations expert has called a form of modern slavery. King went on to defend his tweet with a number of confused and contradictory statements. Sen. Ernst’s flippancy shows how little she and other Republicans think of the grannies and grandpas, dads and moms, and working men and women who have broken their backs to pay taxes and provide for their families. On Friday, Trump claimed he had reached a landmark last-minute immigration deal with Mexico, which meant he no longer had to impose the tariffs he had been threatening, part of his incoherent southern-border policy. Surprising because in its early trailer, FX’s Anti-Phyllis Schlafly Series Mrs. America sold itself as a celebration of second-wave feminism as it waged righteous war against the dark forces of the “patriarchy.” And the oligarch billionaires have been waiting for just this moment, funding massive voter suppression, right-wing media, politicians who tell us that up is down, and efforts to keep their colleague, billionaire Donald Trump, in office. Nancy Pelosi Proposes 1,400-Page Coronavirus Bill Stuffed with Pork Trump has also in his years in the White House frequently praised the use of violence. He told police officers in 2017 that they shouldn’t worry about hitting suspects’ heads as they place them in patrol cars. And on a conference call with governors on Monday, he berated them for not “dominating” the streets of their cities. An analysis by Fox News shows at least eight potential Democratic candidates have voiced support for or touted aspects of the proposal, which amounts to a drastic overhaul of the U.S. economy and government benefit system. Power is pretty much all the racist right wants. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent, accused the majority of weaponizing the First Amendment — an unconscionable position for a person tasked with “faithfully and impartially” discharging the duty to protect the inherent rights of all Americans. The dissenters have perverted the intent of the Founders. It’s none of Sotomayor’s business how we use free expression. It’s her business to protect it. At the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps, Trump argued that a regime of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class. As shocking as it is, even the terrorists of ISIS have been shown for respect for science when it comes to COVID-19 than the Christian Right, American white nationalists and coronavirus truthers. And the more the Christian Right rails against Fauci and social distancing, the more painfully obvious it becomes that they are a white nationalist death cult. So conservative activists are turning to their favorite weapons — bad faith and distraction — to advance an agenda of gender inequality. In a three-part breakdown of how Trump has failed this moment and the nation, (Ret.) Gen. Allen specifically called out this administration singling out antifa—a leaderless movement that is, by definition, anti-fascist—as a terrorist group while ignoring the white supremacists who have been proven to be inciting violence at some of these protests. President Donald Trump clearly wasn’t pleased on Wednesday when he learned that his former Defense Secretary James Mattis had spoken out against him. So the president responded in his usual and predictable way: lashing out on Twitter. Edwards’ allies are pushing a narrative that supporting Rispone is akin to being a racist like infamous white supremacist David Duke. In his ongoing effort to differentiate between himself and Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden is touting background checks but ignoring the fact they do not stop mass public attackers. Worth noting, however, is that Democrats have also been notably two-faced on gun control. As the president spoke about doing “a lot” to address gun violence, while also emphasizing mental health, it was hard not to think of one of the first bills Trump signed into law. Alex Berenson, a former reporter at the New York Times who has written extensively debunking fearmongering claims related to the lockdowns wrote on Twitter Thursday that the tech giant to benefit the most from pandemic stay-home orders is refused to sell his latest book. How far will Republicans go to destroy democracy? In addition to mocking Ivanka for her looks, the exhibit that invites people to throw trash at vacuuming Ivanka Trump lookalike demeans the First Daughter’s success as a business woman and White House advisor to that of a woman with a vacuum—as if something’s wrong with that, too.  Some people hate Trump and mock everything from his geography gaffes to his appearance. They’ve done the same thing with Rush. All of this mockery and vitriol is just an attempt to thwart their real success in revolutionizing American culture and politics. While low unemployment and steadily — if slowly — rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower-income Americans, these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few. Remarkably, the first three years of Trump’s presidency were relatively smooth sailing outside of self-inflicted crimes and mishaps. His actual approach to life was never fully tested in the Oval Office. Now, with the first real challenge of his presidency, he is utterly adrift. He is asking President Trump, a fellow climate change disbeliever and another white nationalist, for help with dousing the fires. Team Trump simply decided to consider changes that would have dramatic effects on those who rely on the social-insurance programs. H.R. 8, as well as other new gun control legislation currently being considered by the House Democrat majority do not accomplish the goal of reducing gun violence. The First Amendment forbids the establishment of a state church in the United States, but it in no way imposes the incoherent burden of religious neutrality on our civic institutions And yes, there’s something in the Fox News DNA over the years that has meant that women political opponents spark a deeper sense of outrage and hate. When the nation\\'s highest civilian honor went to a right-wing media personality, it served as an oddly appropriate capstone to Trump\\'s broader goals. Not only would House Bill 2320 rescind the rights for same-sex marriage, it also would cement into law a litany of far right wing extremist claims, including that being LGBTQ is a “mythology,” government recognition of LGBTQ people is “the greatest sham since the inception of American jurisprudence,” and the proposition that there “are no ex-blacks but there are thousands of ex-gays.” If Donald Trump was willing to have Americans gassed and beaten so he could stage a photo opportunity, what will he be willing to do to retain the presidency come election time? We could also point out how many of us said Trump and his party, unable to pay for their massive tax breaks for the wealthy, would invariably go after Medicare and Medicaid to help finance the tax giveaways – just as Republicans are doing now. The numbers finding broad American approval of Trump illustrate the catastrophe of the impeachment proceedings backfiring on Democrats that were precisely intended to bring the president’s approval numbers down. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last month said she’s baffled by America’s failure to pass stricter gun laws, despite the wave of mass shootings that have taken place across the country over the last few decades. Trump has shown at best a hazy grasp of his actual powers during his presidency and instead has made broad statements about his authority under the Constitution. Trump could sit on live TV, peeing his pants and whimpering that the protesters are coming for him, and his base would stick by him and claim to see courage in the urine puddles below his chair, just so long as he keeps the racism and the lib-triggering coming. They know he’s a “Bunker Boy,” but will pretend they don’t see it until the bitter end. The leader of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been groomed by the right-wing, xenophobic and Islamophobic Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) along with its polticial arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). After Steve King’s offensive implication that white people own Western civilization, Chris Hayes predictably responded with an idiotic remark about Western civilization giving us Hitler. The National Republican Senatorial Committee slammed Senate Democrats for blocking the legislation. Everywhere he went on Monday, Trump was greeted by thousands of cheering Indian citizens, troops of traditional dancers and roadways lined with posters and billboards celebrating his visit. Part of the reason billionaires can swoop in and position themselves as the saviors on so many different issues — climate change being the latest — is that government has failed to take bold action. House Democrats are not currently pushing a firearm registry, but without a complete knowledge of the location of all firearms, universal background checks simply will not work. This account of Trump’s decision-making, based on a senior defense official as well as several others in the Trump administration, offers insight into how the president was pushing for the fastest, most extreme measures while advisers at the Pentagon tried to persuade him that a more moderate approach would work. A new report reveals that the 2017 GOP tax law was rife with monumental self-dealing by rich GOP lawmakers who have since benefited bigly. White people are being asked—or pushed—to take stock of their whiteness and identify with it more. This is a remarkably bad idea. Celebrity activist Alyssa Milano declared at a rally in Washington, D.C. Tuesday that because she has a vagina, she doesn’t have “equality and justice” in America. While Trump has stopped short of invoking the 1807 act to use the military to enforce laws domestically, he’s kept the option open, fomenting further unrest and division. Rather than staging photo opportunities while awkwardly holding a Bible in Lafayette Square, Trump would have issued a formal proclamation calling on the insurgents to disperse if he’s serious about the application of the Insurrection Act. He justified his racism by saying that “many people agree with me,” and by continuing to rave on Twitter about how the real purveyors of “racist hatred” are those who look askance at his embracing the rhetoric of Stormfront and the KKK. While the piece fairly analyzes the fracturing of the white nationalist movement, it makes the bizarre claim that ideas that are widely popular amongst mainstream conservatives, such as ending affirmative action, are actually white nationalist in origin. While Democrats were busy diverting the attention and energy of the entire country into a pointless trial that could not possibly have ended in anything other than President Donald Trump’s acquittal... While, in the wake of the El Paso murders, the media and most of our politicians are acting shocked—“shocked, I tell you!”—that there are armed racists in America who are trying to terrify people of color, the reality is that it’s pretty much always been that way here in the United States. Male and female are the two sexes — but transgender advocates now claim more than 50 “genders” — including agender, bigender, gender fluid, gender non-conforming, genderqueer, intersex, two-spirit, etc, plus “cis-gender” for the 99+ percent of people who are normal, non-transgender people. Like many Never Trump screeds, Will’s criticisms are cloaked around the Republican party. His real issue, however, is with Trump voters. He blames the party for nominating Trump and stocking Congress with “invertebrates whose unswerving abjectness has enabled his institutional vandalism…” But if pro-Trump Congressmen are “invertebrates,” what does that make the Americans who voted for them? Mafia exploitation of immigrants on farms in Italy is likely to rise as the coronavirus lockdown brings chronic labor shortages, the government and labor rights groups have warned. She said she came to her conservatism by studying history without the filter Democrats have put on racism in the United States. In the video, while answering a question of whether conservatives have legitimate fears of Islamic terrorism and therefore justification for measures to stop it, she appears to say that white men are in fact a greater threat. It’s paramount now, as Fox News and the right-wing noise machine try to take down a new generation of Democratic women leaders, that everyone understands the strategy in play. The number of April background checks to purchase a firearm showed Americans flocking to gun stores in high numbers for the second month in a row amid worries about the coronavirus pandemic. AOC, like all powerful women, has to go through a rigorous beauty regimen simply to exist in the public eye. Trump made his predecessor\\'s posture toward Iran a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, suggesting that a nuclear agreement worked out by President Barack Obama on behalf of the USA and five other nations was too soft on the country. Nearly 60 percent of Americans now support the marginal tax rate program Ocasio-Cortez has proposed uncluding a remarkable 45 percent of Republicans, despite all the work right-wing media has done to demonize Ocasio-Cortez and anything related to her. Franklin Graham: Democrats Exploit Coronavirus to ‘Defeat Donald Trump in the Election’ After all, who else are they going to find who would be willing to just openly gaslight members of Congress, telling them not to believe the evidence of the dead in Pittsburgh and Christchurch and El Paso and many other mass-killing sites, by wielding her blackness like a shield? Such criminalization would be accomplished via universal background checks, which Harris\\xa0strongly supports. Of course, the demands of tolerance are not universal. The strong gods are still suppressed and exiled, and the heretic-hunting inquisitors of diversity have become more paranoid and vindictive in triumph. President Donald Trump, however, would have us all eat our “one marshmallow now” with a reckless return to pre-pandemic life. He would risk igniting a second wave of infection, which would entail the needless sacrifice of thousands of more lives and a squandered chance to lay the foundation for a durable post-pandemic economy. He’s a 78-year-old white male millionaire seeking the affections of the wokesters, a gruff socialist with bedraggled hair and\\xa0terrifying policy proposals. Of course, regionally, the Democrat base consists nearly exclusively on top income earners and rich executives who live in metropolitan areas and major cities along the coasts. Putin, who has aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, has proposed a shake-up of Russia’s political system that critics say may be designed to extend his grip on power after 2024, when he is due to leave the Kremlin. The coronavirus lockdowns are America’s most regressive government actions since the draft. Even as liberals have quickly noted the virus’s disparate incidence, they have ignored the inequities of government responses. The declaration that a man’s penis becomes a female penis once a man declares himself to be transgender is built on the transgender claim that men who say they are women are actually women.  For the most part however, Biden’s campaign has faded into the background of American politics as the nation struggles to combat the coronavirus pandemic and a new surge in violent demonstrations engulfing the country in a storm of anarchy. Model and left-wing activist Emily Ratajkowski celebrated Easter Sunday, the most important day in the Christian calendar, by posting racy photos of herself in a thong. Even if Trump is “unraveling” as Never Trumpers are wont to claim, his supporters won’t disappear on November 4th. George Will and the leftists many Never Trumpers now ally themselves with must reconcile their perception of the American people with reality. Remember how incensed people got when Trump floated his (admittedly, impractical) ideological test for immigrants. President Donald Trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in Davos on Tuesday to make the case that ordinary Americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration’s “America first” maxim. Gun control groups hit back, saying the closures are strictly a public health matter — even as a number of sympathetic Democratic governors acknowledge bowing to pressure from lawsuits\\xa0and the Trump administration. \\xa0Democracy probably cannot survive, after all, if one of our two major political parties is indifferent to its fate. Since Trump was elected, the Fox News programming that promotes white nationalist ideas has slowly grown both in airtime and in severity.  House Democrats’ Chinese coronavirus relief package bails out coastal millionaires and billionaires while ensuring big businesses are able to freely hire illegal aliens and visa overstayers over unemployed Americans. As dear leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is fond of saying, “winners make policy, losers go home.” And yet unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate refuse to take the phrase to heart. Which is a real shame. We are just under 280 days into the Trump presidency, yet beyond nominations, Congress has made almost no progress passing the agenda America elected them to enact. The photograph of Katie Bouman sitting in front of her computer with the first black hole image instantly made her the face of the project — which is why an informal coterie of sexist trolls kicked off a sexist investigation to invalidate her contributions. Former GOP strategist Steve Schmidt on Monday rebuked President Donald Trump’s fumbling response to the coronavirus pandemic, suggesting the United States would not be facing “catastrophe” if former President Barack Obama were still in office Thanks to the\\xa0GOP’s commitment to voter suppression, paired with decades of\\xa0phony rhetoric about voter fraud, millions of black and brown Americans have no access to the ballot box. This dark new event revealed that America’s white nationalism problem goes far beyond Trump Though conservatives try to demonize Ocasio-Cortez an Omar, their actual policy views are perfectly mainstream.  The New York lawmaker proposed a 70 percent tax on top incomes — a view backed by public opinion and many well-respected economists. The network also hypes the idea that nonwhite immigrants are dirty and diseased, as well as inherently criminal. Many pointed out at the time of the Park Police’s first statement denying use of “tear gas” was obviously misleading. But Trump and his right-wing defenders jumped on it. Most prominently, Federalist writer Mollie Hemingway wrote a piece, shared by the president, accusing the media of falsely reporting that tear gas was used, even though the crowd was exposed to gases and compounds that clearly caused tears and severe irritation. Leonhardt’s column in the New York Times provides more evidence that elite Americans are so enamored of immigration and diversity that they would throw the college graduate class under the bus rather than give up their visions of ruling over a chaotic and fractured “diverse” society. But even if there was a president in the Oval Office who took the issue seriously, there’s still a do-nothing Senate to contend with. In today’s America, someone with this much money can buy so much advertising and self-promotion that he automatically becomes a Serious Presidential Candidate just by virtue of wanting the job and having the capacity to self-finance a campaign. Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island eloquently blasted Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida during Wednesday’s House hearing on gun control. While Democrats were diverting the attention and energy of the entire country into a pointless trial that could not possibly have ended in anything other than President Donald Trump’s acquittal... Cuomo has been championed by the mainstream media for his response to the coronavirus pandemic in New York City, but his state-wide response to nursing homes deserves anything but the glowing praise he’s received. The NRA has long agitated to crush tougher gun control laws in this country but for its officials to be directly engaged in trutherism about school shootings is a new low. ...we sounded the alarm in the early months of Trump’s presidency, when prime-time Fox News host Tucker Carlson began to experiment with segments that used euphemisms like “Western civilization” to package the idea that white people are inherently more civilized while people of color are a threat to national stability. Even before Trump started to make a big show out of not wearing a mask, it was common, at least in my South Philadelphia neighborhood, to see MAGA-hat-clad white men walking around without masks, delivering contemptuous sneers to the rest of us suckers who are covering our noses and mouths.  That the Secret Service takes precautions to protect the president in a time of chaos is, in itself, to be expected. But the contrast between Trump’s chest-thumping and the fact that he was cowering in the basement was objectively funny.  Unsurprisingly, a lot of people made fun of him, and he didn’t like it. Polling for the Democratic nomination tells a depressing story for those seeking to break the glass ceiling and make the ultimate stand against patriarchy: the top contenders for the Democratic nomination are currently all white men. A good conclusion to draw might be that the charity of the top 0.1 percent and of corporations both are vastly overstated and not even fractionally as useful as simply taxing them at the same effective rate as the rest of us pay, so maybe we should get on with that already. When he finally spoke in the Rose Garden on Monday, Trump threatened to deploy the military against American citizens if the governors didn’t take his advice for a more forceful crackdown. This threat didn’t appear to cow anyone, and only increased the anger.  Democrats are also using the crisis to push for greater immigration, despite the overwhelming public demand that Americans get hired for any jobs during the crash. With this in mind, the Trump administration reportedly hopes to reduce poverty in the United States, not by making a material difference in struggling families’ finances, but by tinkering with the threshold for what counts as poverty. Also, decades of NRA propaganda have convinced people to associate guns with safety and, indeed, as the economy craters, the NRA is treating this crisis as another opportunity to sell guns to people. Despite Democrats regularly characterizing America as socially pathologized with anti-woman “sexism” and “misogyny” — where women face greater cultural, economic, political, and social adversities relative to men — Warren framed her sex as a political asset in comparison to her male competitors for the Democrats’ presidential nomination to defeat President Donald Trump in November’s general election. In recent months, Trump has begun aggressively attacking mail voting, a process that is standard in some states now and which many others are expanding because of concerns that in-person voting could spread the coronavirus. Trump has repeatedly claimed that expanding voting by mail will let Democrats cheat, even though he, his press secretary and a top adviser have all voted by mail in recent elections. It is therefore no surprise that Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the term “Democratic socialism.” Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people. Coronavirus: E.U. blasts Trump\\'s travel ban as it unleashes chaos and confusion. ‘A new low’: Washington Post media critic blows up Tucker Carlson’s absurd lies about white nationalism The utter failure of private capitalism to prepare for the coronavirus should have surprised no one. Private capitalism, as business school graduates repeat, focuses on profit. The “profit incentive,” they learn, makes private capitalism the superior, “most efficient” economic system available. And so, while demonstrations began to spread and police engaged in ruthless attacks on nonviolent protesters, Americans have been subjected to Trump trying — feebly, but at great cost to both taxpayers and public safety — to assuage his ego by demanding that his real life display of weenie-ness be “fixed” with reshoots and post-production edits. Trump\\'s comments came during a mega-rally in the world\\'s largest cricket stadium — part of an elaborate Indian welcome for a president who revels in pomp and pageantry. Sanders\\' team feels he has been unfairly and inaccurately accused of sexism while Warren\\'s allies took special offense to Sanders\\' campaign manager going on TV to say her recollection of events was a \"lie.\" We used to think of interracial marriage as a sign of social progress. Now, thanks to The New York Times, we know it’s just another sinister tool of white supremacy. The normalization effort included softened rhetoric and social gatherings that, for many groups, would increasingly replace confrontational rallies. Haqqani claimed the Taliban are just looking for a round of free and fair elections, laughably pretending the murderous Islamist extremists would cheerfully accept losing and head back to their caves in peace if the Afghan people reject them. We finally know what it takes to get the House to examine gun violence: it’s not a mass shooting; it’s an election. Even before jumping into the presidential race, Biden had showcased a taste for luxury air travel.  Many people in politics and media are still not used to female power, and Pelosi’s novel position, while creating some pointless problems for her, also gives her some surprising advantages. The two men are known to be friendly and frequently golf together at Mar-a-lago. But apart from their friendship, Trump should feel a great bond with Limbaugh. After all, without his three decades of on-air bombast, bluster, and fearless defense of his audience, there likely would not be a President Trump. House and Senate Democrats are responding to the coronavirus outbreak in the United States by supporting measures to effectively strip President Trump of his authority to impose travel bans to protect American citizens. During a speech to Young America’s Foundation’s 41st annual National Conservative Student Conference, Hawley slammed the “reigning consensus” of Washington, D.C.’s ruling class that asserts free trade and endless immigration are vital to meet the needs of corporate leaders, the business lobby, and the donor class while ignoring its impact on middle-class Americans. In an age when media stardom apparently confers some kind of universal expertise, it’s probably not a complete surprise that Republican House leaders keep trotting out pundit/provocateur Candace Owens to testify in congressional hearings on what should be a matter requiring the utmost seriousness and gravity: white nationalist terrorism and its toll on the American social fabric. The mass protests could put Trumpism to a serious test. The president has urged police to come down hard on protesters, and now there’s an endless highlight reel of cops brutalizing people in the way Black Lives Matter activists have always said they do. I have zero interest in contributing to the daily chorus of outrage over Trump’s Twitter feed, or feigning shock and horror over the casual, combative style that fueled him to the GOP nomination and then to the presidency. He does not want Democrats to die. The sky isn’t falling because Trump made a bad retweet. For twenty days, from the day the first death from coronavirus was known, Democrats did nothing about it. They were too busy with the president’s impeachment trial — a trial Pelosi had delayed unnecessarily for several weeks. It can take hard work, creativity, perseverance and luck to become a millionaire, but in today’s skewed wealth system, multibillionaires don’t need any of that — their money does all the work to lift them above everyone else. Trump’s profound megalomania, impulsiveness, and defective character is what got us where we are today. If we are to have any shot at a real recovery, he needs to go. Pompeo appeared hopelessly lost when WSMV’s Nancy Amon was far better prepared for an interview than he was. They found that many disadvantaged white students reject the notion of their grand privileges and resented the key confessional component of white privilege education. Such a ban would have been of little impact because the key element in such mass attacks is time, and the Virginia Tech attacker had all the time in the world because his targets could not shoot back; they were in a gun-free zone. When far-right white evangelicals, white nationalists and coronavirus truthers rail against social distancing and encourage large gatherings, they are encouraging suicidal behavior. And there have been many examples. Bush, who has largely avoided politics since leaving office in 2009, has recently weighed in on the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the death of George Floyd — and while neither statement mentioned President Trump by name, they were regarded as veiled swipes at his handling of both matters. A plan known as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act is a boon to Silicon Valley billionaires, big business elites, and outsourcing firms, as they would be able to readily import more lower-paid Indian and Chinese foreign workers to take American jobs that would have otherwise gone to American citizens. It\\'s not just governments and international organizations that have lined up to express dismay at Trump\\'s move. Experts, entrepreneurs and others have also been quick to condemn the announcement. In the wake of the El Paso shooting, in which 22 were killed and 24 injured, the discovery of a racist manifesto that may be linked to the shooter has pushed white supremacist ideologies into prominence. Frustrated Democrats slammed Republicans for what they see as a debacle that could leave millions of Americans without health care.  This is what Breitbart News has reported, based on publicly available data ignored by the anti-tariff crowd for over a year.  There was no immediate confirmation from US officials about the alleged plan to slash US troop numbers in Germany and cap them at 25,000 in future. But Trump’s lukewarm support of longstanding cooperation agreements with European allies has long caused alarm on the continent. Holding a face mask draped over a pen in his left hand, and reading from a script evidently placed slightly off-camera, Biden labored through a presentation that sought to portray Trump as a plutocrat serving his cronies. But instead of closing loopholes that allow criminals to access firearms, the bill by House Democrats could turn millions of law-abiding American gun owners into felons. Finally, he launched into a meandering rant about Biden, suggesting that under the Obama administration, nothing was done to fix policing in the United States. While the previous administration surely didn’t do enough, and Biden himself has contributed to the criminal justice problems in the country, Trump completely ignored the fact that the Obama Justice Department actually did take significant steps toward reform following the protests in Ferguson. Before President Donald Trump threatened to violently suppress demonstrations in memory of Floyd, before the spread of recording equipment let the world witness how U.S. police brutalize non-white bodies and before “I can’t breathe” became a global rallying cry challenging American cruelty and injustice, America tried to explain its racism to the world. We don’t need to embrace full-on socialism communism, and Ocasio-Cortez is swift to say that, but the floor needs to come up and the ceiling needs to come down. It is no wonder why Republicans insisted on ramming through incredibly unpopular tax cuts for American corporations that were already making near-record profits, even at the risk of losing control of the House of Representatives.  It may have taken Trump to point out the pitfalls of the Chimerica link, but coming up with a coherent strategy to replace it is clearly beyond the president’s abilities. The president has failed miserably at handling the first serious challenges of his presidency: COVID-19 and the racial justice protests, Conway charged. They have not only revealed the incompetence of the “failing, flailing” president, but his inhumanity as well, Conway argued. But rather than appreciate the fact that Asian-American women are considered highly attractive, Lim sees only a sneaking racial bias, a reflection of our upside-down cultural world where victimhood and oppression carry more social currency than even beauty and success. Trump is nothing if not a public relations savant. Once the dust settles, if he cannot take credit for restoring order, he’ll do his best to deflect and lay the blame at someone else’s feet. He’ll remind his followers what the other side thinks of them, how they desecrated our American values, and what will happen to them if Joe Biden becomes the apologizer-in-chief. Women in power must pay a significant tax on their limited time to sit for manicures, blowouts, brow waxes, and braids, rather than meeting with constituents, reviewing legislation, conducting investigations, chasing a story, traveling to their districts, reviewing their notes, or spending time with their families. In an apparent attempt to blame sexism for the blowback the Rashida Tlaib received for her \"Impeach the Motherf*cker\" remark, Pelosi wondered aloud what the response would have been if a man made the same comment.  Just a few weeks later, our divided leaders were taken by surprise by the pandemic, and bickered on cable news, asking why nothing was done sooner. The Trump regime appears to have given up on containing the outbreak and is just focusing on managing the political fallout. This week, the White House rejected its own sensible, science-based guidelines to re-open states, and Trump has left it up to governors to decide how and when to reopen their economies. It matters that figures like Marsha Blackburn are trying to smear a decorated American war hero. It also matters why she\\'s engaged in such a toxic scheme. The startling, aggressive attacks on peaceful protesters by the National Guard occurred after a “pointed threat” from the Pentagon that if the Guard couldn’t handle the situation, active-duty military units would be sent to deal with civilians, the Times reported. If she doesn\\'t want to thank him for his honorable service, that\\'s her business, but these ugly attempts at smearing him are unbecoming of those in positions of authority. In Europe, no government has joined Trump’s anti-Iran crusade (though John Bolton is whispering in the ear of the new Trump-loving prime minister, Boris Johnson.) In Tuesday night\\'s debate, the two progressive senators de-escalated a tense round of tit-for-tat exchanges between their presidential campaigns over the charged issues of gender and electability. Warren’s speech included leftist talking points — from corporations’ alleged mistreatment of American workers and unions to the dangers of “cutthroat capitalism” and the pitfalls of free trade. During that address, Lindell, a former drug addict turned born-again Christian who has donated more than $200,000 to Trump’s election efforts, went off-script, proclaiming to the nation that Trump had been “chosen by God.” Newly empowered Democrats in Washington and statehouses across the country are flexing their legislative muscle with a host of\\xa0tax proposals\\xa0that would affect billionaires and blue collar alike. While the workaday majority of Americans continue to be mired in our low-wage economy, the precious few at the tippy top soared out of sight in 2019. Bernie Sanders Is Crazy, But The Only Democrat Candidate Voters Actually Like The irony, of course, is that the exhibit that invites people to throw trash at vacuuming Ivanka Trump lookalike reflects every stereotype feminists claim to stand against, oversexualizing Ivanka’s body and ignoring her hard work. Even if you don’t speak white nationalist dog whistle, this speech is pretty shocking. Hawley is claiming that the United States is run, and has been run, by a secret group of international “elites” who value terrible things—such as education, achievement, and progress. People were tear-gassed, manhandled, shoved, battered with clubs and slammed with shields on Monday to clear the way for Trump to cross the street from the White House for a photo op at St. John’s Episcopal Church. The onslaught against the protesters began 25 minutes before a 7 p.m. curfew.  After years of being berated as racist or ignorant, Donald Trump reassures everyday Americans that their views are valid and their way of life is worthwhile. He lets them fulfill the only dream most Americans have: to live their lives as they please without harassment or contempt from their government. The targeted killing is the latest demonstration of how, two decades after the CIA spotted but was unable to kill a man they believed was al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, the U.S. has become adept at hunting and killing its enemies, particularly in the troubled regions of the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. But, whether this switch constitutes a true win for the racist right or not, it’s clear that MAGA conservatives are highly attuned to how decisions are made in the White House and which positions they want to control. Democrats Push Pork for Planned Parenthood in Coronavirus Package What this means is that in these particular countries, local law enforcement agree to not enforce anti-gun laws, especially dangerous radical ones like confiscation, bans, mandatory registration, and limiting the size of magazines. President Donald Trump\\'s top health advisers – Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx – showed up at a White House event Friday with protective masks, though the president himself continued to spurn any kind of face covering. It is far from the first time that Trump has offered to intervene in a seemingly intractable international dispute. The coronavirus has presented the president with an adversary unlike any other he has confronted. It cannot be intimidated by angry tweets. It cannot be dismissed with a nickname. It cannot be diminished by calling it a “hoax,” as he did in February. And as the death toll rises, while Trump’s poll numbers fall, a new, old strategy is taking shape. But the president kept his word when it came to the Court. It’s still early in the Trump era, of course, and we really have no idea how the residual political effects of our acute partisan battles or investigations or ugly rhetoric or the often-incompetent presidency will manifest in the long term. Rep. Gaetz, known for spreading fake news, conspiracy theories and lies, and supporting the alt-right, announced to the House Judiciary Committee that undocumented immigrants are to blame for gun violence and building President Trump’s wall would reduce the violence. When Republicans warned Democrats that impeachment was a waste of time, a divisive partisan exercise, and a distraction from the real issues facing the country — a lesson Republicans learned the hard way, in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, 21 years before — Democrats ignored them. Now Modi has made international headlines for yet another similarity: He’s constructing a massive wall … but unlike Trump’s goal of keeping immigrants out, Modi’s wall was built to hide the country’s poverty from the gold-plated American president. DeSantis was initially tentative to shut down outdoor recreational areas like beaches and was ridiculed by the media for his allegedly relaxed response. The Never Trumper Republicans of The Lincoln Project have mobilized former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s scathing broadside against the president in their latest attack on Donald Trump. But the British Government — and this one’s Conservative; imagine what a Labour one would be like! — is so wedded to green ideology and so nervous of the well-funded anti-fracking campaign industry that it has imposed such extreme precautionary principles on shale gas exploration that the fracking industry has effectively been strangled at birth with red tape. I\\'m also struck by Blackburn\\'s style of needlessly toxic politics, once again questioning the patriotism of a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran who earned a Purple Heart. He is enjoying the benefits of those guns while working hard to be sure average Americans cannot own them. ...immigrants as criminals and eugenics, all of which were once considered fringe and extreme. White nationalists embrace white supremacist and white separatist views. The House Democrats’ 1,400-page coronavirus recovery bill threatens the livelihood of millions of American graduates and their families by expanding work visas for many of the roughly 1.5 million foreign college graduate contract workers who hold jobs in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez, who advocates for democratic socialism, is not the only Democrat in Washington, D.C., honing in on billionaires these days. Nevertheless, Trump and other Republicans have tarred the protests as havens for terrorists intent on destroying property.  Miller is the architect of President Donald Trump\\'s hardline immigration policies that have separated children from parents, forced people seeking asylum in the U.S. to wait in Mexico under squalid conditions, instituted the Muslim ban and poured money from the military into border wall construction. This, of course, was before the president ignored his national security team, withdrew U.S. forces from northern Syria, and effectively invited Turkey to launch a brutal offensive against our Kurdish allies. For years now, Fox News has been mainstreaming arguments that used to be the province of  fringe websites run by neo-Nazis and other groups who believe the U.S. is meant to be a country of white people and for white people A specter is haunting the West; our elites see intolerant authoritarianism—along with a plethora of related “-phobias” and “-isms”—everywhere. Trump, who ran on a promise to build a southern border wall, used the outbreak as another opportunity to attack Democrats\\' position on immigration and border security. The transgender effort to suppress any recognition that men and women are different and complementary would not matter except for the movement’s political alliance with wealthy progressives and radical feminists who wish to destroy the political power of the male-and-female family. Before they decide whether to let this stand, congressional Republicans should probably have an uncomfortable conversation. Radical Virginia Citizens Defense League has organized a rally in Richmond for January 20, and the event is already attracting out-of-state pro-gun folks, including a potential horde of white nationalists. There is no way to fling the footage into the Trash folder, or to edit the crap out of it until it sends the “right” message. Trump’s continued demands that the world act like a reality-show producer who can keep giving him mulligans only reaffirms that he is, above all things, a narcissistic moron. The whole endeavor, born of desperation, became an embarrassing fiasco for the president, but there was an underlying point of real significance: Trump and his allies realized that the American mainstream didn’t see the value of the regressive GOP tax plan, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy and big corporations. California has a ten-day waiting period on gun purchases yet that state also witnesses some of the most heinous public firearm-based attacks in the nation. While Democrat presidential hopefuls aim to weaponize the tax cuts, Elaine Parker, chief communications officer of Job Creators Network (JCN), told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview in January that it is precisely what will assist Trump in making his case to the American people. The 2016 election of Donald Trump as president so outraged large groups of women that they protested against him in record numbers the day after his inauguration. Rep. Al Green (D-TX) at a hearing on Wednesday perpetuated the hoax that President Trump called white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 “very fine people.” The U.S. manufacturing jobs boom comes as free trade economists, billionaire donors, and establishment media pundits have routinely claimed that Trump’s 25 percent tariff on imported steel and ten percent tariff on aluminum would cripple the American economy. We could turn our attention to the fact that Republicans spent much of the last decade falsely accusing Democrats of supporting Medicare cuts through the Affordable Care Act, only to have a GOP White House actually propose taking an ax to the social-insurance program. How the coronavirus pandemic shows that Christian white nationalism is a much greater threat to the US than radical Islam We did consent to the lockdowns and now are suffering under the insanity that has flowed from them—economic suicide and petty local laws that serve no purpose other than to nanny us into submission. Even Richard Nixon, to whom Trump likes to compares himself to, was occasionally willing to venture out into crowds of protesters to talk to them. Trump, however, is such a wuss that he made his cadre of protectors tear-gas people rather than subject himself to a crowd’s insults. Far from proving he was a tough guy, Trump’s actions only led to another round of taunting about his wimpiness. Americans generally associate white pride with slavery, segregation, and skinheads. For most of us those are negative associations so, yes, we think it’s creepy to be proud that you’re white. In fact, Clinton’s plan is so inept in its ability to understand how college funding even operates, and so atrociously far from providing any adequate solutions to a complex problem, that it sounds like she was channeling the Simpsons. Israel has a vested interest in escalation, not de-escalation, with Iran. President Donald Trump offered an unusual warning to Virginia farmers on Tuesday, suggesting that gun control will leave their potatoes defenseless.  President Donald Trump said Friday he has drawn historic lessons from an unusual source, none other than Richard Nixon – but then he quickly argued he hasn\\'t followed all the examples of the only U.S. president to be forced to resign his office. Rep. Steve King’s (R-Iowa) comments on race earlier this month elicited a warranted firestorm of indignation across American politics and media. The bureaucrats and local would-be dictators concocting their various plans to protect us all from each other have to be relieved of their power or the police state will be permanent. So how did we get here, and how do we reclaim our liberty and the right to take risks to survive? U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday promoted her ambitious welfare legislation to constituents in her home district in New York, finding a friendlier audience than she often encounters in the glare of Washington. The message from the Bouman backlash is that if you are a woman who becomes the face of a massive scientific breakthrough, sexist internet trolls will spend way too much of their time harassing you and trying to disprove your credibility. Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it. Supporters of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) are blaming her lackluster Super Tuesday performance, in part, on sexism, contending that she would be the frontrunner if she were a man. Dogging Bloomberg’s campaign are allegations that he made inappropriate comments toward women and that his company, Bloomberg LP, fostered a hostile environment for female employees. Bannon, who previously served as Executive Chairman of Breitbart News, has denied the false claims spewed against him mostly by those on the left. Trump has weaponized the word “hoax” throughout his presidency, using it to belittle and discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference as well as his impeachment trial. That damage was in evidence in a report from the U.S. Labor Department, which showed just under 3 million new jobless claims last week, pushing the seven-week tally well over 36 million. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders says he wants to spend a whopping $2.5 trillion over a decade to guarantee all Americans – regardless of income – safe and affordable housing. After Stephen Miller\\'s white nationalist views outed, Latinos ask, \\'where\\'s the GOP outrage?\\' Putin remains popular with many Russians, although his trust ratings have taken a beating after the introduction of a very unpopular pension reform in 2018. Moreover, NeverTrump would not only have to separate Trump from his political base, but also to win the support of that base for its own candidate. That will be particularly difficult, as NeverTrump has made no secret of its general disdain for Trump supporters. He lied about matters large and small. He refused to shake House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\\'s outstretched hand. He talked up a divisive culture war. Banks lamented that China has now become a partisan issue simply because Trump has blamed China for trying to hide the discovery of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China, and allowing it to spread to the rest of the world. The irony of these two particular invites–Brinkley and Kasky–is that they tell of story of gun control’s failure in Florida, rather than gun control’s success. Trump proceeded to ignore multiple other attempts made over subsequent weeks by his advisers and Republican allies to get him to take the pandemic seriously. Instead he dismissed their warnings as “alarmist” and would go on to hold a number of rallies (seven) and golfing outings (three) between learning of Obama’s pandemic playbook and ultimately declaring a national emergency. Well-intentioned politicians might want to provide a solution for student loans, but millennials won’t start making smart decisions unless they have to foot the bill for their own education. Unfortunately, no bailout or special program can save students suffering from a lack of responsibility. The Senate Republican leader said that some Democrats told him in private they were embarrassed by Pelosi and Schumer’s political stunt. Despite pre-existing and new guidelines, critical decisions made by governors and state leadership have, in some cases, exacerbated the crisis. In New York, Gov. Cuomo’s instruction for long-term care facilities to continue accepting patients with COVID-19 led to devastating results. The dynamic exposes two underappreciated realities of Trump’s Iran obsession: Any U.S. war on Iran will ignite war in Iraq, and U.S. credibility is visibly faltering across the region.  Ironically, bans on “high-capacity” magazines are part of the Bloomberg campaign’s gun control push, yet a Virginia Tech review board found that such a ban would have had a negligible impact on the results of the 2007 attack. Trump has repeatedly boasted about and taken credit for the stock market’s performance during his three years in office, including as recently as last Saturday after a strong rebound the day before. Trump has also warned that Wall Street would fall if a Democratic candidate wins the November presidential election. Considering the negative, often false propaganda uttered by politicians hostile to Social Security and the financial services industry, and misleading media coverage, that is not surprising, that many young people have been conditioned to think they should not count on Social Security to be there when their time to retire rolls around. However, Democrats, including some of the 2020 candidates, have continued to push a narrative that Trump called white supremacists “very fine people,” when he clearly did not. The biggest problem for NeverTrump, however, is the pitiful performance of the Republican Congress, which has been unable to act on its core priorities, and reinforces the notion that only Trump is strong enough to lead the party. But it’s getting increasingly difficult to maintain the myth that the enormous wealth inequality in not just American society but the entire world somehow reflect a system that’s fairly rewarding people for their talent and labor. Sweden, another highly “progressive” country, has also introduced various schemes revolving around gender identity in schools, with preschools addressing children by the gender-neutral pronoun “hen” and encouraging them to play games traditionally associated with their opposite gender. Of course Trump doesn’t care about other people, only his ego and his appearance. Reporting from the Associated Press confirms this, as a Thursday article explained Trump told advisers that wearing a mask would “send the wrong message.” And sure, Republicans are stupid enough to go out and get infected, doing the virus’ dirty work for it. But the economy isn’t going anywhere as long as most people, who are sane and smart, refuse to put themselves in danger for a movie or haircut. A previous boom that saw gun sales double over a decade through 2016 corresponded largely with Democratic President Barack Obama’s time in office, when fears that gun control laws would be enacted drove gun aficionados to stock up. The El Paso attack has also put new pressure on a man some white nationalists praise as helping advance their movement: Donald Trump. Extreme gun advocacy group called Rocky Mountain Gun Owners cares more about fear-based fundraising and the money it generates than the policies they claim that money supports. Among rich lefties, perhaps, this new reality was acceptable, as it dovetailed with their guilt over their own success. Authoritarianism experts who worried about Trump’s tendencies during his campaign and his first years in office are now sounding fresh alarms following the clearing of a park adjacent to the White House on Monday using gas, flash-bang grenades, pepper pellets and other aggressive tactics ― all so he could stand in front of a church he does not attend and be photographed holding a Bible. In 2016, Donald Trump fueled his improbable presidential victory with an arsenal of catch phrases designed to incite and excite the Fox News and Breitbart audience who live in fear of America’s diversity and inevitable demographic changes. My point is that it was a bait-and-switch, and not in a crazed, left-wing state like California.\\xa0 Welcome to the longest U.S. economic expansion in history, one perhaps best characterized by the excesses of extreme wealth and an ever-widening chasm between the unfathomably rich and everyone else. It’s also true that in no time in modern American history has a president’s disposition and rhetoric conflicted more dramatically with the outcomes of his administration. But that has been a net win for the Constitution. The suggestion that the use of the phrase \"ladies and gentlemen\" is a real threat to transgender individuals downplays their actual struggle for acceptance in modern America. Female genital mutilation is illegal in Germany, leading many families to travel to their country of origin to have the gruesome ritual performed on their daughters. Trump has kept it up ever since, instructing federal police to tear-gas peaceful protesters outside the White House on Monday evening to clear the area for his ludicrous photo-op holding a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Square, a stunt that outraged the bishop who oversees that church. He then criticized the attempt to lump Republicans and white nationalists into the same group. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic candidate for president in 2020, called out President Donald Trump for not doing enough to nip white nationalism in the bud, and thereby being partially responsible for mass shootings like the one in El Paso on Saturday. Every corporate mainstream media organization has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that tariffs were hurting U.S. consumers. Top Six Awful Democrat Ideas Senate Republicans Blocked from Coronavirus Bill... The moment was yet another headache for Biden as he struggles to appeal to gun owners.\\xa0 The Treasury Department’s inspector general is looking into the opportunity zone program following stories by ProPublica and The New York Times about how the tax break meant to help the poor had been manipulated by billionaires. Factual analyses have dismantled this false narrative put forth by some in the mainstream media. For the latest grisly example of hypocrisy, “progressive” cronyism, feminist cry-bullying, and Deep State entrenchment, look no further than Britain’s Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies. An angry Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) slammed Democrats for voting against the bill and blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for nixing bipartisan negotiations over a coronavirus package. Trump supporters obviously don’t want to admit this. If you turn on Fox News, read Breitbart and The Daily Wire or browse through the cesspools of YouTube or Reddit, you’ll find plenty of people who spin or defend Trump’s bungling. Angry Democrats blamed Republicans for what they see as a debacle that could leave millions of Americans without health care.  A group of 20 wealthy individuals – including left-wing financier George Soros – signed a letter Monday, begging for a wealth tax and arguing that the U.S has a “moral, ethical, and economic responsibility” to tax wealthy individuals more. The report is an in-depth analysis of the Parkland shooting and offers a searing critique of the school and sheriff department’s ability to stymie the bloodshed. Given the potential enormous risks of destabilizing the region, the Trump administration needed a strong justification for launching the strike that killed revered Iranian military leader Qassim Suleimani. Trump was caught on tape during the visit apparently telling his wife to “smile” (she briefly complied, but then spent the rest of the visit looking like a hostage) and then generating images that are terrifying, but not for the reasons the president may have hoped. The fact that many Democratic women are no longer convinced that a woman can beat Trump, and are supporting white men for reasons of electability, is a tragedy.  It is also worth noting that the “white nationalist” in question, Patrick Casey, does not claim to be a white nationalist but an identitarian activist, a group the far-left media regularly attack as racist. Rowe then dismantled each of Atkins’ unsubstantiated points. He lambasted celebrities for constantly broadcasting their political opinions as though their views have any impact on most Americans. To the thinking person, the claim doesn’t make sense. How could this be a new phenomenon adopted from the small white nationalist movement when mainstream conservatives have been fighting to end affirmative action for decades? Students across India on Tuesday stood in solidarity against a vicious weekend attack on a prestigious New Delhi university by masked men wielding sticks that led to 40 students and staff being sent to the hospital. Donald Trump’s victory last November was not just a repudiation of the Democrat Party and Hillary Clinton. No, 2016 was a revolt against the entire Washington establishment, both on the left and the right. Don’t forget, Trump blew away everyone in the Republican primary too, from accomplished governors to Jeb Bush (R) from Tea Party darlings to washed up Senators. Trump wiped the floor with them. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi debuted a 1,120-page coronavirus rescue bill after Democrats tanked the Senate proposal on Sunday night. The white supremacists and other far right extremists are super-gun-owners, they are armed to the teeth, and law enforcement is understandably reluctant to get them het up. At least 25 transgender or gender-nonconforming people were killed in violent attacks in the United States last year, according to the Human Rights Campaign, which has been tracking anti-trans violence since at least 2015. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez casually spotlighted her revolutionary rejection of biology, sex, and the male-or-female society during a live Facebook chat in which she was asked about her views on the military draft. It’s all part of an endless, dehumanizing Fox News campaign to silence opponents, and specifically to silence and intimidate Democratic women. Moynihan never described the specific spiritual benefits that would arise from the kind of cutbacks needed to solve a future government debt crisis. But in explaining how excessive public spending undermines traditional values, he was clearly suggesting subsequent belt-tightening could have the reverse effect. Pompeo confronts simple questions he just can\\'t seem to answer. He misses the fact that the bank shooting highlighted\\xa0the failure of gun control–particularly Florida’s red flag law and waiting periods–rather than the need for it. The white nationalist who said “Hail Trump” and “hail our people” during a conference in Washington D.C. on Saturday — and who received straight-armed Nazi-like salutes in response ... Even the European Union (with the Maastricht Treaty in 1993) has adopted the radical economic and political ideologies of Thatcherism and Reaganism—neoliberalism—that benefitted wealthy elites while forcing austerity on its poorer member nations, inflicting massive pain and inciting right-wing movements in Greece, Spain and Italy, among others. He pointed out, in blunt and colorful language, that economic suicide in pursuit of the latter goal is insanity. His video went viral. For one thing, Trump’s impatience now threatens to undo the measures of the last ten weeks. Thanks in part to the foment of anti-lockdown protesters tacitly endorsed by Trump, governors are under increasing political pressure to reopen quickly—perhaps too soon. Numerous gun control proposals have been thwarted in the U.S. Congress, largely because of opposition by Republican lawmakers and the influential National Rifle Association gun rights lobby. Sen. Elizabeth Warren is aggressively pushing a new wealth tax – which she’s dubbed the “UltraMillionaireTax” – ahead of this weekend’s formal presidential campaign launch, but keeps running into the same question from critics: Is it even constitutional? Lebanese citizens from across sectarian divides came together in a rare display in unity late last year after proposed tax hikes enraged an already struggling populace. Fearful and insecure Americans are taking advantage of weak and ineffective gun-control laws and stocking up, as President Trump might say,\\xa0“like never before.” In a bizarre and unexpected twist, pop super star Lana Del Rey is being smeared as “racist” over an Instagram post in which she slammed modern-day feminism. The Clinton plan won’t work because it’s a progressive, liberal, quasi-socialist plan applied to something that should operate like a business within a free market Many Latino voters know from personal and family experience how U.S. foreign policies drive people from their homes.  They are, she believes, the Founding Fathers\\' insurance policy against tyranny – the safeguard for every other right spelled out in the U.S. Constitution Those filings are expected to show that Sen. Sanders, the so-called democratic socialist, made millions from book sales. Cancellation of a two-week United Nations meeting on gender equality, female empowerment and “women’s issues” due to the coronavirus outbreak sparked an outcry from 12,000 disappointed delegates, diplomats and non-government organizations scheduled to fly into New York for the event and work towards ending “default male thinking” across the globalist organization. Tuesday on Hill.TV, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson declared President Donald Trump has become a “megaphone” for white nationalism. Former Australia Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ripped Donald Trump’s botched handling of the coronavirus pandemic in a new op-ed, describing the U.S. president as a “quack apothecary” for hyping unproven cures The Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by police murdering Black people, predates Trump’s presidency by several years, but the president personifies the kind of systemic racism the movement has always decried. Social Security 2100 Act will provide an important forum to help educate the public and could puncture many of the toxic myths that have taken hold about Social Security in recent decades.  We just survived eight years of a messianic presidency, with a finger-wagging, patriotism-appropriating administration lecturing us on how to be proper Americans. Earlier, the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert claimed on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s describing himself as a “nationalist” serves as an indication of his hidden sympathy for white nationalist movements such as Ku Klux Klan. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) slammed billionaire Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world and owner of the Washington Post, for paying his employees what she called “starvation wages.” This is why Donald Trump is awake at 2:30 a.m., rage-tweeting. When he sleeps, he dreams, and his dreams are nightmares. He’s a frightened, desperate man. Every day, he turns on his television, and the death count from the COVID-19 virus keeps going up.  Cohen said political leaders are playing with fire when they promote white supremacist talking points, such as exaggerated claims of the security threat immigrants present and their supposed drain on public resources, to stoke their supporters. So while these Republicans in D.C. are still lost in the mindset that voters will still support them because \"they\\'re not the other guys,\" that\\'s not entirely true: promises were made, tens of millions of dollars were raised off said promises. Time to man up, Republicans, and fulfill those promises or else people might call you for what you\\'re acting like right now: liars. On the other hand, it’s also true that men often use the “it’s not me, it’s the world” cover to discourage women’s dreams and ambitions, and often for self-serving reasons. Fox News has gone so deep into white nationalism that Donald Trump now believes it’s how he’ll win in 2020 Just off the top of my head, CNN is already filled with useless and uninteresting Never Trump deadwood. Republicans, however, are likely to vehemently oppose the plan to tax the wealthy. Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” economy has led to record-low unemployment for the bottom-tier of working and middle-class Americans, as well as major wage hikes thanks to a tightened labor market. Instead of motivating kids to payback their loans, Clinton’s plan might actually lead to the decline in liberal arts enrollment. And although nearly every Republican has sold their souls to Trump, none of them want to cross someone with the moral authority of Gen. Mattis, who counseled Americans in no uncertain terms to abandon Trump. A majority of Americans do not agree with Democrats’ gun violence demagoguery.\\xa0 Democrats and other critics blasted Trump\\'s plan to reduce the scope of the task force Tuesday, given the threat that death tolls would rise as states reopen businesses and other parts of their economies. He reiterated his criticism of the president’s response to coronavirus in the spin room after the debate, saying that Trump was incompetent. Two years ago, America’s white nationalist movement stunned the country. Neo-Nazi demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, had turned deadly when a far-right protester drove a car through a crowd, killing one and injuring dozens. Tens of thousands rallied peacefully and the news media treated it like it was the start of the second civil war or at least another violent confrontation like Charlottesville. However, much discrimination in today’s workplace is not intentional but fueled by unconscious gender stereotypes. The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules that help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women. Shortcomings in the technology used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and insufficient training of the agency’s staff have made transgender and gender nonconforming travelers particularly vulnerable to invasive searches at airport checkpoints, interviews and a review of documents and data shows. However, the GOP tax cuts benefited small business and the middle class — not just the wealthy, as several Democrat candidates have suggested. Working-class Americans, like those who make up the majority of South Bend residents, have secured the largest wage hikes in the nation compared to all other economic demographic groups — a direct result of Trump tightening the labor market. And if we look at a subset of guns which the left  loves to deride - rifles, for instance - then a clearer picture about gun deaths is quickly visible. During the campaign, it was clear that much of the momentum behind NeverTrump was driven by narcissism, as well as by self-interest. NeverTrump gambled on a Hillary Clinton victory, preparing to blame Trump supporters and hoping to take revenge. American manufacturing jobs have boomed to a more than 20-year high as President Trump has imposed a wide range of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and Chinese products — dooming predictions made by free traders that have yet to pan out. While Americans still cling to sexist gender roles at home, overwhelming majorities believe that sex discrimination in public spaces should be illegal. While no one is praising Trump as a thought leader in the way Limbaugh has been, he’s undeniably made conservative ideas tangible for average Americans. Billionaire Democrat presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg is a staunch proponent of gun control for America with one caveat–he gets to spend his days surrounded by good guys with guns to keep him safe. The Trump tax cuts also doubled the child tax credit and expanded its eligibility, which greatly helps the American working-class family. Few could have anticipated that the historic release of the first image of a black hole would devolve into a public spectacle of sexist outrage — though such are the times we live in, in which literally every news item is picked apart by reactionaries. Ultimately, the best way to defeat the idea of white supremacy is to ignore cartoon villains like Spencer and Anglin. They’re bigots, losers, and attention-seekers who survive on the oxygen the media gives them. his is another example of Trump’s false dichotomy between saving the economy and fighting the virus. After all, the economy isn’t going to recover if millions are sick and people are afraid to leave their houses — and early evidence from the states that have tried to “reopen” their economies makes that clear. For that matter, Christianity is equally anti-suicide. And yet, the Christian Right and many of President Donald Trump’s far-right white evangelical supporters have been encouraging behavior that is suicidal.  Instead of giving way to despair, Christians should master themselves, strive for virtue, and suffer with dignity. The virus and shutdowns, grave as they are, will pass, but everyone can learn from them and be more than members of the passive herd beholden to external forces. But at least ISIS had enough common sense and scientific knowledge to realize that coronavirus posed a major threat to its members; in the U.S., the Christian Right and white nationalists have failed to take coronavirus seriously. For Democrats, this wave or new regulation, censorship, and civic pressure will free the less-than-one-percent of people who say they are transgender from the oppressive, outdated rules of male-dominated supremacy. While, in the wake of the El Paso murders, the media and most of our politicians are acting shocked that there are armed racists in America who are trying to terrify people of color, the reality is that it’s pretty much always been that way here in the United States. The astute observer will note that China is not exactly eager to take in large numbers of migrants or refugees from beyond its borders. The self-flattering conceit that sustains NeverTrump’s criticism is that Trump supporters are participating in a cult of personality.  For some on the right, all references to massacres such as these are supposed to avoid phrases such as “mass shooting” and “gun violence,” because the rhetoric, according to the right, might imply there’s something wrong with guns.\\xa0 However, this is not the senator’s first time criticizing Bannon based off of misleading reports in the media. Donald Trump claimed he has seen evidence the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, as he threatened tariffs on Beijing over its role in the global pandemic. The Republicans’ corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. But our new research disproves the admittedly tempting idea that merely putting a woman in power improves gender equality.  The hot new idea to tax America’s rich is a wealth tax, which – although designed to target the wealthiest taxpayers – could end up eventually hurting middle-class families. What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. Today, the cumulative stress of Donald Trump’s escalating trade war is leading to if not an irreparable breach between America and China, then certainly a significant fraying. As we got into the cab, our tow truck driver, a middle-aged man from Brooklyn, wasted only a few minutes before bringing up Trump with missionary zeal. He told us that he hated politics and hated politicians, but loved Donald Trump. Why? Because Trump is the only one speaking up for people like him. Former Vice President Joe Biden lied on Monday about his past position on the best way to deal with the novel Wuhan coronavirus rapidly spreading worldwide that would eventually bloom into a global pandemic. Even after climton\\'s loss in 2016, the network tried desperately to drag her back into the spotlight, to juice up its long-running narrative that she’s a an all-powerful force of marauding feminist evil, which viewers embrace with lust. Free trade has helped gut working and middle class American jobs and stripped whole middle American towns of their industries and livelihoods. While a number of transgender advocates and LGBTQ health experts applauded P&G’s decision to redesign the Always packaging by removing the female signs, the company’s announcement sparked criticism online, including a bounty of transphobic commentary. The bill would also provide a massive giveaway to the many technology, banking, insurance, and staffing companies that have replaced a huge number of U.S. graduates with large blocs of compliant Indian and Chinese graduates. On one hand, it’s true that a female candidate would face an uphill battle against the ingrained sexism of the electorate, not to mention the vicious misogyny of Donald Trump. Donald Trump used his mighty Twitter platform to drum up business for his golf course in Los Angeles on Sunday. U.S. deaths from COVID-19 neared 80,000, but the president didn’t tweet about that.  This prohibition is but the first portion of the implementation of I-1639, the gun control initiative pushed by millionaires and billionaires and passed by voters on November 6, 2018. For a lazy narcissist like Trump, that must have been a life-altering realization: Hollywood fakery can make even the biggest idiot appear smart and capable. So he has spent the entire presidency, which he thinks of more as a fake TV job than a real one, using photo-ops, pep rallies and other stunts to try to shape an image of himself as sharp and tough, an image that runs totally counter to reality. Politicians have no business directing or defining patriotism — especially when their rhetoric sounds like 1950s-era Soviet sloganeering. Reducing the upper tax rate can often, counterintuitively, increase total government tax revenue — because the rich, instead of engaging in complicated (but legal) tax avoidance schemes, are happy to pay what they consider a fair rate. Liberals, sadly, were not prepared to let whiteness remain Times New Roman. They poked and they prodded, and eventually got the resentful backlash they were provoking. Trump — who has been criticized for painting an overly rosy picture of the outbreak, often contradicting his own health officials ... However, there is evidence suggesting that having cops in schools can help perpetuate the school-to-prison pipeline ― the cycle in which students, particularly students of color, are pushed out of school and into the criminal justice system when school authorities criminalize student misbehavior. While Pace receives her spiritual grace from a Christian God, science has shown that faith in a supernatural wonder, whatever it may be, that bears powerful benefits on an individual’s mental and even physical well-being. The SPLC last year released hundreds of emails of Stephen Miller,the architect of Trump’s immigration policies such as the child-parent separations at the border and the Muslim ban, in which he cited and promoted \"explicitly white nationalist websites.\" Trump’s evangelical cabal are behind Republican attacks on women’s reproductive rights. The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait like an article arguing white supremacists have an Asian woman fetish. Donald Trump is not an ideas man. This has been a defining feature of his presidency. He’s not a learned policy wonk, understanding the complex nuances of law and governance. He is, at his core, just a former game show host and a con man. Wall Street surged on Thursday as investors weighed the prospect of economic recovery against bellicose remarks from President Donald Trump regarding U.S.-China trade and a whistleblower’s dire warnings about the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, Moynihan was primarily concerned that irresponsible politicians promising their constituents an insupportable array of handouts would jeopardize America’s economic well-being.  These numbers also help illuminate Democrats’ thinking: Since Trump has no wiggle room with his base, they are content to watch consequences pile up, driving Trump’s overall numbers further into the ditch. Mulvaney apparently didn’t see this line of inquiry coming, so he was left in an awkward spot: Democrats are trying to embarrass Trump, but his chief of staff has no idea why Trump would be embarrassed by his own tax materials. While his supporters have included many strains of nationalism and populism, he did run as a Republican, and this will hopefully work in his favor. Many Americans are hopeful, excited, and looking forward to a Trump presidency. Here are some of the reasons why. Pompeo also spoke with the Wichita Eagle in November, and that interview turned messy, too. It should be clear by now that no matter how bad the violence gets, López Obrador is not going to do anything about the cartels. Of course, viruses don’t just “go away” regardless of the amount of propaganda or wishful thinking you throw at them. His theory, however, is telling. Trump’s strategy from the beginning of this crisis has been to minimize the threat and wish it away. So it was creepy when Obama was trying to replace American idealism with progressivism and calling it “economic patriotism,” and it’s creepy when Trump does basically the same thing under the guise of economic nationalism. The whiteness of the protests alongside the stark racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality underscores that the desire to reopen businesses is rooted in white supremacy. As if it weren’t already clear, in Michigan where the nation’s most prominent protest took place, armed white men demanded an end to the lockdown while carrying Confederate flags, swastikas, and nooses. Assad has been at war with the rebels since 2011 and has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons against civilians and other human rights atrocities to cement his control over regions that oppose his rule. Trump wore no face mask nor any other protective gear, which is typical for him, despite recommendations to the contrary by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He stopped to talk to employees — who were wearing white lab coats, masks, gloves, goggles, hair coverings and plastic booties — while they were working with the sterile swabs. The U.S. president has come under sustained criticism for his racially incendiary rhetoric since launching his candidacy in 2015 — including his repeated use of the word “invasion” to describe immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border. The American president’s threat to reverse that decision and impose the metals tariffs is the latest example of his mercurial approach to trade policy. The result of this tribalism will not be a catharsis of white identity, improving equality for non-whites. It will be resentment towards being the only tribe not given the special treatment bestowed by victimhood. Never mind the fact that some of Trump’s strongest supporters have had no problem whatsoever in criticizing him for substantive reasons — as in the backlash against his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. NeverTrumpers still believe themselves to be the unique guardians of conservative orthodoxy and honest punditry. After Donald Trump’s outrageous photo op in which he used federal police to attack peaceful protesters so that he could walk to a church to hold up a Bible, others noted how inappropriate it was for General Mark Milley, the current chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to not only be tailing behind Donald Trump during this publicized stunt but to be wearing his battle fatigues, something extremely inappropriate for the setting. The intersectionality-obsessed media claims Buttigieg doesn\\'t have enough diversity points to run for president.

President Donald Trump has been doubling down on his love of tariffs this week, vowing to increase tariffs on Chinese imports. Populist eruptions and governments from Brexit to Budapest to President Trump are perceived as confirmation of their fears, necessitating increasingly ferocious efforts to defend liberal democratic pluralism and its virtues of openness, tolerance, and inclusivity. There were many reasons that Trump defeated Clinton in 2016, and sexism was surely among them.  Shortly after he took office on Monday, California\\'s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unearthed an unprecedented new health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering dramatically more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting the embattled\\xa0Affordable Care Act, which a federal judge\\xa0recently struck down as unconstitutional. Ernst, one of the Senate’s leading government waste hawks, unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would end a carveout for millionaires to obtain a taxpayer-funded unemployment benefit during the coronavirus outbreak. Trump was a major factor in the early rumblings of white nationalism on the network, which gave him considerable airtime during his reality TV days to air conspiracy theories about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. In truth, these examples are caricatures of Epicureanism. Epicureanism is not hedonism; rather, it abhors lack of restraint and shameless debauchery. After all, these things bring more pain than pleasure. As the deadly COVID-19 contagion sweeps across the country, gun sales are surging, spurred in many regions by panic buying and purchases by first-time firearm owners.  By Monday morning he was considering a dramatic move — invoking the Insurrection Act so that he could use federal troops to enforce the law. According to a senior defense official, Trump wanted 10,000 federal troops immediately on the streets to control a situation some aides believed could escalate dangerously. Some movement leaders regrouped. Instead of stoking outrage, they set out to build support with another tack: Looking normal. Closing the gender pay gap is not rocket science – even though recently graduated female rocket scientists earn 89 cents on the dollar to their male peers.

The Roman Catholic Church allows only men to be ordained as priests and women have traditionally been consigned to the shadows of its administration. Spencer speculated that the media may be \"soulless golem,\" a reference to magically animated beings from Jewish folklore. The House Wednesday overwhelmingly backed a resolution condemning President Donald Trump\\'s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a rare bipartisan rebuke at a time when the president is trying to shore up GOP support to stave off impeachment. One of the bitterest cases in academe involved Steven Salaita, whose offer of a tenured faculty position at the University of Illinois was revoked in 2014 after he posted a series of tweets harshly critical of Israel. Young white men, reacting to social and educational constructs that paint them as the embodiment of historical evil, are fertile ground for white supremacists. So Acevedo’s war on gun shows would do little to prevent criminals from getting guns, but it might keep a grandpa from buying a shotgun he was going to use to duck hunt with his grandson. King’s defense understandably rang hollow, as he has a long history of making comments ranging from insensitive to downright unacceptable. Whatever the specifics of what Donald Trump’s diagnosis may be, from the moment protesters started to hit the streets to denounce police brutality, one thing was certain: The president’s brainworms would direct his energies away from doing anything useful and toward the task of managing his ego, relying on the reality TV tricks he mistakes for the real work of presidenting. But the wealthy have a clear incentive to make minor tweaks to the existing system instead of overhauling it to create a truly sustainable society because they profit from the world as it is, not as it could be. America is likely to remain a relative manufacturing wasteland, as barren as Trump’s own ill-conceived ideas on trade. We might note that at the time of this Texas ruling, national liberals were spluttering with outraged opposition. The president and his Republican brethren made all kinds of predictions about what would happen if their tax plan passed, and each of those predictions – from job creation to growth rates to the fiscal impact – turned out to be wrong. Following a terrible school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year, CNN hosted an\\xa0anti-gun rally\\xa0that whitewashed Sheriff Scott Israel’s fatal errors. Can the loyalty of Trump voters withstand racial tensions, cities on fire, stores looted, and people being beaten and killed in the streets? Yes. If the left keeps comparing gun owners to slave owners. If they advocate throwing white women out of airplanes; if they beat their neighbors with two-by-fours; if they murder a 77-year-old former police chief and broadcast it on Facebook Live. Mainstream media outlets continue to print false and defamatory descriptions of Breitbart News in a nakedly political effort to marginalize a growing competitor. The Republican president entered the initial round of talks with the North Korean dictator in Singapore with minimal preparation – Trump went so far as to mock the very idea of doing pre-summit homework – and soon after, he made a series of concessions to Kim Jong-un in exchange for effectively nothing.\\n Biden spoke passionately Saturday night about handing out food to children and adults with his wife, Jill, and his grandchildren earlier in the day as he blamed President Donald Trump, who has proposed and begun to implement deep benefit cuts for federal subsidies benefiting the poor Issuing a defiant call to arms to grassroots Republicans, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon railed Friday against dangerous “global elites” and the Silicon Valley “lords of technology” whom he said are robbing U.S. citizens of jobs, wealth and opportunity.

Trump, who has sparred back and forth with the teenage climate activist Greta Thunber, made the comments in a press briefing just before he was about to depart the annual World Economic Forum meeting in the Swiss ski resort. There’s one recommendation frequently left off the list of common prescriptions for reducing our individual carbon footprint that would have the greatest impact on mitigating the climate crisis and moving toward the United Nations’ sustainable development goals: have fewer kids. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., defended his support of the controversial “Green New Deal” on Friday, by comparing the government-led push to overhaul the nation’s economy and energy sector to landing on the moon and defeating the Nazis in World War II. Equally important, he notes, is that it is difficult for incumbents to distance themselves from Trump over fears he will turn his base against them — meaning they are in a trap of their own making. And one particularly radical idea is sure to grab the attention of young people around the country: wiping out student loan debt for the vast majority of American borrowers. The curfews, which have never before occurred on an Election Day in recent times, were a response to looting that occurred after generally peaceful protests against police violence and racism. However, the curfews also come in a climate where the Republican Party, led by President Trump, has been repeatedly making false claims that voting by mail is rife with fraud Rather, it’s because of the sheer fact that she was a woman, and in her country and beyond, women’s soccer still suffers from a lack of investment, a lack of attention and a lack of care.   An hourlong oral argument Wednesday inside the Supreme Court could go a long way toward reversing abortion rights in the USA.

Donald Trump became the first U.S. president to attend the annual March for Life in Washington on Friday, unleashing a fierce attack on his Democratic rivals during a rally in an election-year show of support for opponents of abortion rights. The Trump administration has made it clear that abortion is neither health care nor family planning. The COVID-19 pandemic may be a unique situation where we can actually transform the economy to not only make it better for workers but also for the climate. But pockets of vaccine skeptics have helped cause outbreaks of measles and whooping cough.  John Coughlin’s burgeoning career was recently shrouded in controversy after the U.S. Center for SafeSport placed a temporary restriction on his eligibility to be involved figure skating on Dec. 17, USA Today first reported.  But even those who take steps to better their financial situation often end up stunting their opportunities in the long run thanks to the high cost of financial services. College offers a prime example. A firefighter was killed by a falling tree while battling the Australian wildfire crisis overnight, and the prime minister on Sunday said his government was adapting and building resilience to the fire danger posed by climate change. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, added that Republicans are fighting “pure evil” on the part of those who would kill babies after being born. But COVID-19 is shaking her views. The woman who would identify herself only as Stephanie, citing a fear of reprisals from committed anti-vaxxers, says she is now 50:50 on taking a vaccine should one be discovered for the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. Mnuchin aroused controversy last week after he told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he did not consider the outspoken Thunberg to be a legitimate critic of fossil fuel investments.

Refugees have become a hot button issue as millions attempted to flee the terrorist group ISIS and the southern border was swamped with asylum claims. In New York, a mother-to-be faces childbirth without her husband, in Texas, hundreds of women seeking abortions are turned away, across the country, women are facing postponed mammograms and devastated by suspended fertility treatments. But there’s another equally damaging consequence of student loan debt that’s talked about less often: its impact on borrowers’ mental health. That’s certainly not something that’s discussed with 18-year-olds as they prepare to sign the dotted line on a 10-year loan. As Santa Claus loads his sleigh led by flying reindeer, climate change proponents are spreading the story of the animals’ plight because of global warming. The U.S. moved aggressively over the past year to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving at its southwest border through a series of measures aimed at making it a less attractive option. \"Orange Is the New Black\" star Yael Stone is renouncing her U.S. green card to return to her native Australia in order to fight climate change. Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, announced during the March for Life rally Friday that he has launched the first pro-life caucus in the U.S. Senate. The rollback of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), called an “international treasure” by one former EPA official, will allow the fossil fuel industry to quickly get approval for new projects that could send climate-warming, pollution-causing emissions into surrounding communities, as well as harm wildlife habitats and federally protected lands, with scant oversight. Other protests in 2019 included swimmers from Australia and Britain refusing to join world championship gold medalist Sun Yang on the podium because the Chinese star has been implicated in doping violations. In February, Mexican illegal alien Pablo Hernandez was driving a pick-up truck when he struck a six-year-old boy and a 16-year-old teenage boy as they were crossing the street.

Four states will hold their primary contests on Tuesday night, despite Georgia and Louisiana each postponing their elections previously scheduled for a few weeks later over concerns of the spreading Wuhan virus. One driving force behind the record rates of youth sports officials and referees quitting is increasingly abusive and belligerent behavior by parents, including verbal abuse, threats and even fights.

We speak with Varshini Prakash, founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate group that has occupied and lobbied at congressional offices, risking arrest to demand adoption of the Green New Deal and bold climate leadership. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a Trump administration order that allowed state and local governments to refuse the resettling of refugees, finding the policy likely “unlawful.” The idea behind the conspiracy is that these miracle vaccines — and they are medical miracles — can cause autism, when there is no data to back that up. The DACA amnesty-for-wall funding plan is despised by Trump’s most loyal supporters who have warned the administration against caving to the big business lobby and billionaire donor class, both of which have pushed for an amnesty for illegal aliens for the last two years. Spanish football was marred by a player being racially abused during a league game on Saturday, along with street clashes between rival fans outside stadiums before two matches. The idea of exposing your child to something that could potentially harm her, and in a catastrophic way, is terrifying. The flurry of hirings brought the NFL under fire Tuesday from those who think the league’s “Rooney Rule” – an NFL policy that requires teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations jobs – doesn\\'t do what it\\'s intended to do. The sharp reductions documented in carbon emissions and air pollution caused by coronavirus-related lockdowns have offered a sort of preview of the kind of improvements that can be made when drastic action is taken. Minhaj, who used to appear on “The Daily Show” before getting his own Netflix series, “Patriot Act,” last year, aired an episode in February in which he broke down the often confusing but debilitating problem of crushing student loan debt in the United States. Research shows combining vaccine misinformation with alternative medicine, homeopathy and diet content this way is one of the most pervasive and persuasive techniques used by anti-vaccination advocates to forward their agenda.

Climate change is threatening global coffee yields as changing temperatures and rainfall patterns affect plant growth. Though the indictment of a woman for her own pregnancy loss is unusual in Alabama, it is not unusual for prosecutors to charge people with murder even if they never killed anyone.  Yet Merril Hoge, a former running back for the NFL\\'s Pittsburgh Steelers and Chicago Bears later turned ESPN analyst, has been one of the most outspoken critics against the alarm surrounding CTE studies – putting much of the research down to “science fiction” and “misleading” science far from a factual realm. Lawmakers specifically said they want to protect women from facing unfair competition from men who claim to be transgender women. An internationally known virologist with a military background explained to Breitbart News the United States is vulnerable to potential pandemics due to production of vaccines overseas and a lack of interest in making significant changes to the National Pandemic Plan. Gamblers and reality TV stars can claim bankruptcy protections when in financial trouble, but 44 million student loan borrowers can’t. Unemployed, underpaid, destitute, sick, or struggling borrowers simply aren’t able to start anew. Those assumptions were bolstered this week when Justice Stephen Breyer signaled in a dissent that Roe’s days may very well be numbered. Alzheimer’s patients, lower-income preschool children, and HIV and cancer patients are among the Americans whose needs may go unmet so that the Trump administration can afford to detain thousands of migrant children. Although Biden had voted for the Hyde Amendment continuously over the span of his 40-year political career, the public acknowledgment drew the ire of pro-choice groups and activists.

Yet no one denies that older nuclear plants, with an aged infrastructure often surpassing expected lifetimes, are extremely inefficient and run a higher risk of disaster. Proponents of better compensation and labor rights for college athletes have hammered the NCAA on numerous fronts over the last decade, with federal lawsuits, attempts to unionize, legislation in statehouses and Congress, and new leagues that aim to compete for top-tier athletes by paying them more than the NCAA allows. Democrats effectively nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 by transferring eight million loans into the federal government’s hands. The author of the piece Omar tweeted out seemed to have no problem with wiping out $1.5 trillion in student loan debt and promising everyone a subsidized higher education. Large majorities of both parties seem to like the Green New Deal, despite efforts by Fox News to paint it as disastrous. Loeffler blamed leftist media, especially the Daily Beast, for perpetuating narratives that she might have violated statutes against insider trading. She continued, noting that the media created the narrative against her because, like President Donald Trump, she is a political outsider. So if you decided a career in art history was worth the price, it shouldn’t be the government’s job to pay the bill for your student loans––even if it’s not your fault that the cost of college has exploded in recent years. The legislation ends criminal penalties for self-abortion and – in the case of an unborn baby who is the victim of a homicide – defines “person” as “a human being who has been born and is alive.” Parents held rare public demonstrations as fears of a government cover-up grew, driven by a history of vaccine problems turning out to be much worse than Chinese officials originally admitted, combined with the government’s tendency to suppress popular discontent and suppress those who ask awkward questions.

In response to Hawley’s criticisms, Sargent went to his blog Monday night to accuse Hawley of racialist dog-whistles. Bloomberg did not reference specific jokes. ABC News reported in December that it obtained a copy of a 32-page booklet distributed at a party in 1990 that included sexist remarks by Bloomberg, reportedly compiled by his colleagues. President Donald Trump accused Democrats of “politicizing” the deadly coronavirus during a campaign rally here on Friday, claiming that the outbreak is “their new hoax” as he continued to downplay the risk in the U.S. This was not the president’s first gesture of warmth in the wake of Limbaugh’s sad revelation. The president took to Twitter to cheer him on, saying, “Many people do not know what a great guy & fantastic political talent the great Rush Limbaugh is. There is nobody like him. Looking for a speedy recovery for our friend!” But few people who describe themselves as transgender wish to live as members of the opposite sex, and even fewer wish to undergo cosmetic surgery.

Health care and education costs have also outpaced inflation, that has left many in the middle class struggling to pay their bills day-to day: More than 20% of middle-income households spend more than they earn, the report says. Reports that dozens of Iranian-Americans were detained at the U.S.-Canada border on Saturday and questioned about their “political views and allegiances” were met with alarm by lawmakers and rights groups, particularly given the soaring military tensions between Iran and the U.S. following the Trump administration’s assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. The death of the postal service would deprive Americans of a way to vote, pay bills, apply for passports, get prescriptions, send letters, receive tax refunds, collect Social Security and ship items ranging from gold bars to cremated remains. In 2018, Trump spoke wistfully about Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ability to change the constitution and scrap limits on the number of terms he could serve. And today he is trying to get Russia reinstated into the Group of 7, the organization of large democratic economies, even as Putin seeks to extend his presidential term until 2036 and still retains control of a portion of Ukraine, the reason Russia was expelled from what had been the G8 in the first place. Germany tries to stop Trump from luring away firm working on coronavirus vaccine. He has been critical of illegal aliens, but not immigrants in general. Weaver nonetheless implies Trump is somehow responsible. The hearing comes a day after the Democrat-led House held a hearing to discuss the alleged threat of white nationalist terrorism to the country. Transgender ideology says each persons’ preferences are — and should be — unconnected from their bodies. It says that men and women are interchangeable, and can switch their sex by switching their own sense of “gender identity” so that men who say they are women really do become biological women, complete with female penises. The legislation also provides work permits for a huge number of illegal migrants who have jobs in the very broad category of “essential critical infrastructure.” That category includes janitors and food workers in hospitals, as well as stoop labor in agriculture. But Bannon — the former Harvard Business School grad, Goldman Sachs managing director, and Hollywood mogul — cast California as a linchpin in the fight to halt the spread of what he called the globalist and elitist agenda. He urged Republicans to organize, rise up — and put up a fight to hold on to California House seats that are considered vulnerable in 2018. Reportedly, some of the NRA’s payments that may constitute a conflict of interest pass through financial channels that intentionally obscure the recipients. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota recently sparked a major controversy when she criticized U.S. support for Israel and used some rhetoric that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was quick to denounce as anti-Semitic. While Pence and the president have tried to paint a rosier picture of the virus and project a return to normalcy, some members of the task force are eager to resume appearances from White House grounds Trump has publicly taken aim at Germany – even threatening last year to impose tariffs on foreign cars sold in the U.S. – over trade deficits. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney took to Twitter on Monday morning to attack President Donald Trump, using the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to suggest that Trump is a racist. This would be enough of a problem in normal times, but now, experts say, the widespread, sometimes indiscriminate use of tear gas on American civilians in the midst of a respiratory pandemic threatens to worsen the coronavirus, along with racial disparities in its spread and who dies from it. President Donald Trump is getting called out on social media after posing in front of a church with a Bible ― a photo-op possible only after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters to clear the area.  Logging and mining operations have accelerated their destruction of sizable patches of the Amazon rainforest during the coronavirus pandemic. New laws in Virginia demonstrate that state lawmakers can deliver sweeping gun control measures even in a state where a vocal, well-organized opposition is fierce about protecting its guns and proud of its hunting tradition. Putin said last month Russia would not legalize gay marriage would not let the traditional notion of a mother and father be subverted by what he called “parent number 1” and “parent number 2” as long as he was in the Kremlin. Experts have warned that a total U.S. withdrawal from Syria, which is still embroiled in a chaotic civil war spawned eight years ago by protests against dictator Bashar al-Assad, would advance the interests of Iran and Russia. In an echo of her iconic 1995 speech in Beijing as First Lady, where she declared that \"human rights are women\\'s rights and women\\'s rights are human rights,\" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered a speech on Dec. 6, 2011, to the United Nations declaring, \"Gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\" In Haiti, President Bill Clinton admitted—after he left office—to a “devil’s bargain” on rice tariffs that was “good for some of my farmers in Arkansas,” but destroyed rice farming and generated hunger and malnutrition in Haiti. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. The White House has defended Miller in previous statements to media, raising Miller’s Jewish background in that defense. By forcing us to abandon our regular routines and habits, if not our livelihoods, the pandemic has led us to postpone many of the activities from which we derive joy and pleasure. Our society often operates under the premise of instant gratification, a concept that has gone out the window given the uncertainty surrounding the virus. Victoria’s Secret spring campaign featuring transgender and plus-sized models marks a dramatic shift toward progressive feminism for Victoria’s Secret, which has been roiled by management changes in the past year. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump said US special forces would be withdrawn from northern Syria, in what was widely seen as betrayal of the Kurds and a green light for a Turkish attack. Conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook shooting have persisted for years, for example, far-right InfoWars host Alex Jones claimed that the whole thing was staged by the government with child actors and no kids were harmed ― which ultimately led to a lawsuit against him by parents of the victims. White nationalist arrested for alleged threat against Ohio Jewish community center. Until recently, there seemed to be no broader plan behind NeverTrump’s early, and vigorous, opposition to Trump and his administration. But the contours of a plan have begun to emerge, particularly on social media, where the movement’s criticism of Trump alternates with praise for some of his opponents in the 2016 Republican primary. Perhaps that is why both Warren and Sanders have gone out of their way to hammer home the fact that their proposals would only affect the wealthiest Americans. Jurek, a Sanders staffer in Iowa, was caught arguing that gulags were beneficial for the Soviet Union and suggesting they could be used to re-educate both Trump voters and billionaires. Court filings show the NRA is in shambles — and Wayne LaPierre hopes his lawyer can ‘keep him out of jail’ Trump has also threatened to impose an additional 25 percent tariffs on $325 billion worth of imports from China.

Fauci has consistently done media interviews with a range of outlets, which has annoyed the president, this person said. With Democrats fuming over Trump\\'s push for a border wall amid a still-unresolved funding standoff, those guest lists signal the president could face a tough crowd. In New York City, the national epicenter of the disease, the same racialized outcomes are observed, with more African Americans being hospitalized and dying from the disease than any other racial group, followed by Latinos. Using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\\'s definition of anti-Semitism, Canada’s vote for creation of a Palestinian state does not delegitimize Israel, any more than Canadian criticism of any other state delegitimizes it. White supremacist violent extremists can generally be characterized by hatred for immigrants and ethnic minorities, often combining these prejudices with virulent anti-Semitism or anti-Muslim views, the DHS report states. Navalvny has for years been accusing Putin and his entourage of rampant corruption. But there may be a more innocuous place for white supremacist propaganda to spread: Amazon currently sells multiple books that espouse racist and white supremacist ideologies on its platform. Trump lost no time in tweeting his delight at the court’s ruling on a complaint brought by several Republican attorneys general and two Republican governors. As a result, income inequality now rivals that of the robber baron days of the early 1900s, when labor unions were virtually outlawed while corporate monopolies thrived. The GOP controls both the legislature and the Michigan State Capitol Commission — the two entities that could enact a ban — and neither appears willing to act. As the debt crisis unfolds, the idea of allowing social science to drive public policy, even if it were somehow affordable, will prove increasingly objectionable. As if barren grocery store shelves and daily chaos amid the spread of coronavirus were not enough, would-be Southwest Florida vacation property renters have been refused refunds by Naples and Fort Myers Beach landlords, who are faced with their own set of financial distress. A group of House Republicans gathered Tuesday on Capitol Hill to express their anger over two bills proposed by their Democratic colleagues that, if passed, would drastically tighten federal gun laws. But it was Hawley’s keynote address at the National Conservatism Conference that nailed down who he is, what he believes, and where his party is going in a way that should be absolutely terrifying for every American.'"
